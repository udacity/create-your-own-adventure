Selamat datang kawan...
The best city to visit in Indonesia:
- Medan (The only place i know HAHAHA)
	- Berastagi
	- Parapat/ Danau Toba/ Lake Toba
	- Pantai Yamaha : to have some fresh seafood. You must go there during the lunch time
	coz you can request a real fresh seafood right after from the sea.
	- If you are non-muslim and you do really like pork. Try Kwetiau Ateng in Jalan Sumatra
	- You should try Martabak Manis, its kind of a pancake and there are two choices, one is tipis (thin/crushy) and tebal (thick/juicy) those are made with a lot different toppings. The most basic and recommended topping are Chocolate + Peanut for both thick and thin choices. The last one is Martabak Sayur, its a fried can be say fried pancake, i don't know how to describe it but it is fantasticly DELICIOUS ! you are going to love it so much !
	- Go to Jalan Semarang where you can find a lot of foods there, from chinese foods until the local culinary
	- Nearby Jalan Semarang there is something called Jalan Selat Panjang, it does not as much as in Jalan Semarang, but its still good though
	- Many more local foods you can find there, but be really becareful when by something from the side road as the hygenic of the foods are not really guaranteed and if you have sensitive health about hygiene, it is recommended to be really careful with it
	- Last but not least, you can try DURIAN, which some people might find it ridiculous, because they just not get used to the smell of it. But honestly its really good, but never try to combine it with coffee or beer if you still want to talk to real human.
