In the lap of himalayas there's an astounding story of thousands of villages and
their people, their culture and living.
how these people live their day to day life is completely different from the urban
or what we say a modern sophisticated society is all about. They don't think about
any competition with other people because they are all the same. their competition
is with nature, the natural calamities for which they are not even responsible,
(yes we are).
For them technology is still the invention of transport and electricity or a smart
phone which are now the basic needs of a modern human. No proper education,
no infrastructure, they are in the lap of himalayas.
Opportunity for them is to leave their villages and come to cities, for work and
money. And this has led to an even bigger problem Desertion. Lots of people in search
of work have moved to cities leaving their homes and lands for a better tomorrow.
their homes have now become forts which used to be a heritage of the mountain culture
is now vanishing.
And the obvious thing is that nobody is bothered not even the government nor the
local politicians, cause profit is missing in that equation.
the urban people choose these places as holiday destinations, spend a week or so
and move on.
technologies like artificial intellegence and iot are like the stories to them.
Some would say that life is easy there because they dont go through the stress
and depression , a man living in a developed city with a godd job is facing,
no politics, no jealousy, no agony. But they also fight with nature every now and
then forest fires, land slides, cloud bursts and what not.
I hope someday I will be able to bring the change without affecting the purity of
this heaven on earth.
