> **Cuélebre** ([Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturian_language)) or **Culebre** ([Cantabrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabrian_dialect)), is a giant winged serpent-[dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) of the [Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias) and [Cantabrian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabrian_mythology), that lives in a cave, guards [treasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure) and keeps *[anjanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjana_(Cantabrian_mythology))* (also known as *xanas*) as prisoners. Although they are immortal, the cuélebre age, and their scales become thick and impenetrable, and [bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat) wings grow in their bodies. They must eventually flee Asturias and fly to the [Mar Cuajada](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mar_Cuajada&action=edit&redlink=1), a paradise located beyond the sea.
