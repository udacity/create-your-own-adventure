> The **Xana** is a character found in [Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias) [mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth#Mythology). Always female, she is a creature of extraordinary beauty believed to live in fountains, rivers, waterfalls or forested regions with pure water. She is usually described as  small or slender with long blonde or light brown hair (most often curly), which she tends to with gold or silver  combs woven from sun or moonbeams. The origin of the [Asturian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturian_language) word *xana* is unclear, though some scholars see it as a derivation from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) name for the goddess [Diana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)). References to where the mythological xanas lived are still common in Asturian [toponyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponymy). They also appear in Eastern [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)) and [Cantabrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabria) mythology (Anjanas)
