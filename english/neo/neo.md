You remain still, slowly close your eyes and begin meditating on the
power building in you moment by monent.
You simultaneously realize the futility in so many of your prior efforts
you laugh inside...while inside your nemesis.  
The feeling of peril is erased as your existence continues peacefully, 
at one, enlightened.
Congratulations, you have reached Nirvana.
