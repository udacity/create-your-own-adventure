In 1979, Dr.Moon, the founder of Tong-Il Moo-Do, asked Dr.Seuk to teach this sport
at the Belvedere Training Center.
After that, he started touring a couple of American campuses giving lectures on
Tong-Il Moo-Do and unification of martial arts.
After some time, the sport spread to East Asia, South America, East and West Europe,
Africa and many other places. Right now the sport has become a world sensession.
There are a couple of competitions for it now like the Peace cup and others.
It would be great if you could read a more elaborate [history about this sport](http://www.tongilmoodo.com/about.html)
