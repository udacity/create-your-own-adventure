Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.

In other words, you reap what you sow.

That in mind, what would you prefer to do right now?

Either go for a [run](../coffee/Run/run.md)? Or perhaps [drink a beer](../drink-beer/drink-beer.md)?

Perhaps you'd prefer a spot of [meditation](../meditation/meditation.md) to cool your nerves?

Failing that, I suggest you just play some [Overwatch](../overwatch/overwatch.md), I mean, it is the best game ever. I personally capped out at 3384 SR after 750 horus of gameplay. Life well spent? IDK.
