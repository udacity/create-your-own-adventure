You look in your pockets for some chocolate and graham crackers.

You find them.

You put the chocolate on top of one graham cracker.

You tear off part of the marshmallow arm.

You put another graham cracker on top.

You use the lighter to heat up your S'more until the chocolate begins
to melt and the marshmallow is toasted.

You eat.

You try to go back to sleep.
