I made my parents happy today.

Today, I pooped in my neighbor's garden, so that his zucchini may grow large and deep green in color.

Due to the extra fertilization he grew more zucchini than he and his family
could eat. The extra was donated to a local food bank.

He also gave some zucchinis to our family. Mom cut them up and cooked zucchini pie for dinner.

My favorite vegetable is zucchini and my sister's favorite dish is zucchini pie, so you can imagine how happy we were.
