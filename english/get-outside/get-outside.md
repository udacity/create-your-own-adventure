Its the Summer, I have been stuck inside on too many must get done projects since December.
Time to get out of town and get some mountain air.
Gear loaded, truck full, out of San Jose driving into an "Im on vacation sunrise"
North on 680, East over Altamont pass, hwy120, Knights Ferry, Groveland and the mountain air starts
to kick in.
That was 6 hrs ago, after Olmstead point you are now waking up from a nap on your own private beach
at the west end of Tenaya Lake..
A short drive to Dinner and a Bed at Toulumne Meadows Lodge.
Tomorrow you head out for some quality time off the grid..no comms no signals.
You have a choice of South to Vogelsang or North to Glen Aulin.
Whats it going to be ?
