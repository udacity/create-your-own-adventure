You have a word with the marshmallow who tried to grab the lighter.

You both chat away happily, he apologises for going a bit crazy.

He didn't realise it was you, he likes you!

So much so he offers a bit of mallow from his walls to add to
the cup of cocoa you find in your hand.

You think that's a bit gross as he's essentially offering some
of himself to you but you go with it.

That drink turns out to be the best hot chocolate and marshmallows ever!

Once you finish it you think what shall I do next?
