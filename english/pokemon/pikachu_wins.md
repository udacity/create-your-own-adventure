You bring out your Pikachu and Pikachu uses thunderbolt on the marshmallow! You win!
To celebrate, you take a moment to pull out some graham crackers and chocolate
and make smores.
You feel refreshed and everything is ok.
The best feeling!

However, you don't get to enjoy your victory for long.  You awake from your dream and
realize that Pikachu isn't real but the marshmallow nightmare is still a problem.  What will you do next?
