Then you go for a stroll down by the river and cross paths with an elderly Japanese man with a kind, wizened face. You smile at each other. 
He speaks little English but is able to share a little nugget of wisdom with you, an old Japanese proverb;
"Fall down seven times, get up eight". 
You thank him and both continue along in opposite directions.
