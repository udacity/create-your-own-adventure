You ready for this?

All you need is:

1) Flight ticket to somewhere exotic
2) Backback with a change of clothes 
3) Personals: Cash, credit card, iphone and passport 
4) Travelling companion (optional)
5) That sense of adventure (not optional)

Now, go ahead and:

1) Take backback, travel companion (if applicable) and personal belongings to airport
2) Board flight (ideally the correct flight, or not :D) 
3) Arrive and clear immigration (if applicable)
4) Rent wheels
5) Hit the road. Don't look back and let the adventure begin!

See yâ€™all on the other side. And don't forget to post those insta stories :D

What I miss!?
