I have wanted to change careers for some years now.

Getting books and buying courses didn't help until I met Udacity.

She has been the difference and now I am confident I can be a developer.

I am glad you also met [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com)

The question is do you keep using the free courses or plump for the nano-degree?

Never stop learning!

But when things are getting really difficult, are you going to [quit](../quit/quit.md)

No you aren't going to quit. There are a ton of other resouces, just please keep trying!'

Thanks alot Udacity for teaching me git and github
