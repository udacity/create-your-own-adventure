Hermione, her distaste for Snape's rule-breaking 
overwhelming her respect for Hogwart's professors 
screams "How could you do this? Being a Death Eater is 
one thing but being drunk at Hogwarts is 
unforgiveable!"

Snape did not hesitate for a moment in his response.
"I'm not drunk, you're drunk" Snape slurred back, much
to the joy of everyone in the classroom but Hermione.
