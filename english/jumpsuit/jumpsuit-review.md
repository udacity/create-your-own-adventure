That jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid. It's right here in your [file](jumpsuit-review.md)
Hi, Tim here. Yes, that jumpsuit is awful. Please see the link above. 
Jumpsuits are underrated. I love a jumpsuit.
Why are jumpsuits so great? You're right, I do love them.
Love em or leave em, jumpsuits are part of our fashion.  You could sport one of Gold [Lame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lam%C3%A9_(fabric)), Silver [Sequin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequin), or some Wild Multi Colored [Paisley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_(design))!
