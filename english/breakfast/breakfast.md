You see a pot of coffee near you and you realize that you are hungry. Well, you poured coffee in a mug and picked some 
marshmallows from the wall and added them to the coffee. While you are drinking the coffee and eating those delicious 
marshmallows and staring at the wall you found that you made a whole in the wall by picking marshmallows. You finished
your flavoured coffee and got out from marshmallows-walled room. It is a beautiful sunny day.

Suddenly, you start to sing your favorite song from childhood: "It's a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood".
Thereafter, you remembered the hole you made in the wall and started thinking of going back to fix it.
