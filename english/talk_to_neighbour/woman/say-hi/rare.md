The alien seems surprised that you said hello and replies:
"Thank you! Very few humans have been polite enough to acknowledge my existance at all."
"Because you were nice, I will increase your intelligence by 10%"
Suddenly, you feel 10% sadder.

However, you realize you've seen this alien before. You're pretty sure this was one of the aliens from "Independence Day," starring Will Smith.
