In the rear-view mirrow you see an oddly shaped thing laying in the middel of the road...

Without paying attention to the road, you drive off of a cliff!

Just as the car accelerates off the cliff edge, you remember you have that cool ultra-portable-easy-to-deploy
parachute you got from kickstarter! In a second, it's strapped on. You roll out of the car,
deploy, and gracefully float down into the dessert as the car crashes below. Whew!!
