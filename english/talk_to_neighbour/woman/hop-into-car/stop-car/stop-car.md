You've stopped the car to investigate. 

You walk up, slowly, to a dark lump alongside the road. Shaking in fear, your
ears ringing and you mind racing, you fail to notice another car coming down the
road until it's headlights are on you. Panicking, you stumble onto the ground 
and...

The driver of the car suddenly feels a big bump.
