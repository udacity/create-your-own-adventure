"I'm FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder," the man says in a monotone voice.
The man looked very stange. I was scared and looked frantically for the woman
I saw the woman and ran toward her.

As I ran I failed to notice a hose running along the ground.
I tripped over it and went sprawling headlong.
I picked myself up and continued running toward the woman.

[Talk to the woman](../woman/scully.md)

"WAIT!" shouts Mulder. "I have a special mission for you."

[KEEP RUNNING to talk to the woman anyways](../woman/scully.md)

[Stop to talk to Agent Mulder about your mission.](english/talk_to_neighbor/man/mulder_mission/mulders_mission.md)
