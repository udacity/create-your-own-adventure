"I'm FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder," the man says in a monotone voice.
The man looked very stange. I was scared and looked frantically for the woman

As I ran I failed to notice a hose running along the ground.
I tripped over it and went sprawling headlong.
I picked myself up and continued running toward the woman.
