 Coral reefs are doing lot of favour to us , as a human we need to return favour to it right !!
 How do we return favour ??
 Coral reefs are effected by Overfishing , pollution and coastal infrastructure development . Ocean absorbs more than 9o% of heat from earth surface. We are heating our earth with Green house gases Which is hard for coral reefs to survive at high temperatures . We , every human being need to check the global warming and reduce the global temperatures less than 1.5° C to protect the coral reefs , which are homes to quarter marine life.
