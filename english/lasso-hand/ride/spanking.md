You decide you've been bad and deserve a spanking.
The hand is happy to oblige and paddles your bottom red

After it spanks you, it pulls you out of the wall

You sit in the middle of the floor crying, back where you started, sans rope, lighter and fork.

The hand watches intently, silently, in the bird position.
