Vaporization is  transition from the liquid phase to vapor phase.

There are two types of vaporization

(i) Evaporation
(ii) Boiling

Evaporation is slow process and the liquid does not need to be at boiling temperature for it to happen.

Boiling only happens at the boiling temperature. The liquid needs latent heat to move from liquid stage to gaseous stage.
