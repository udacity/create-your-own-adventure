You are in your in apartment, but somehow you feel lost, and alone.
Everyone is gone and every single door in the building was left open.
You don't know where to go and you are trying not to panic.
Someone is crying and you can hear it echo across the hallway.

You have two choices 
- Grab your backpack and [run away](http://goo.gl/toJbjz).
- Go find out where the [crying voice](http://goo.gl/jB40Nh) is coming from.
