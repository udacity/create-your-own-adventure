Each konnakol phrase is broken up by a sequence of beats as syllables, if you will:
Note: This may not be the standard konnakol language; this is what I was taught in Jazz school

1 - Ta
2 - Ta Ka
3 - Ta Ki Ta
4 - Ta Ka Di Na
5 - Ta Da Ki Na Tohm
6 - Ta Ka Di Na Ta Ka
7 - Ta Ka Di Na Ta Ki Ta
8 - Ta Ka Di Na Ta Ka Jo Nu
9 - Ta Ka Di Na Ta Ka Ta Ki Ta
('Na' can be replaced by 'Ni' at will)

Now to demonstrate the use of konnakol, we will take an instrumental section of Frank Zappa's "Inca Roads", and
incorporate konnakol phrases and sequences to the rhythms underlying the sections unusual time signatures and/or
unorthodox phrasing. The section starts at [5:42 in the song]:

Note: a '-' means a beat that is sustained for an extra beat
