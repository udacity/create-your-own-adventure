Social media are taking too much of our life.

I used to have a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) account.

I found that my [real life](https://github.com/Salsabeelyf/create-your-own-adventure/blob/master/english/real-life/real-life.md) is not fine.

So, i decided to [self control](https://github.com/Salsabeelyf/create-your-own-adventure/blob/master/english/self-control/self-control.md) it, so i deactivated the account.

Now, i have more time to [work out](https://github.com/Salsabeelyf/create-your-own-adventure/blob/master/english/work-out/work-out.md) , [read a book](https://github.com/Salsabeelyf/create-your-own-adventure/blob/master/english/read-a-book/read-a-book.md) or do whatever i want.
