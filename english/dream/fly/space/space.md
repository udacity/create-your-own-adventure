If it's a dream you should be safe, without all that
mumbo jumbo space equipment needed. And saving couple
millions on that is quite nice, really!...

So you head off to galaxy far, far away....

You eventually reach a solar system with a planet that has intelligent life.

While you are there, they explain that dreams are actually the real Universe 
and our reality is a delusion we've created to give ourselves a way to escape
to a more consistent existence.
