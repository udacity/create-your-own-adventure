Which is real if I remember all of the times in my childhood 
when I flew in my dreams. I would decide the dream is more real 
and reality is a dream. It would be more fun to live where I can

Shakespeare so beautifully put it in his play Hamlet: 
"to die, to sleep 
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
the heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
that Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; "
