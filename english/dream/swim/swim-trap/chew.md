As Ursula the Sea Witch pulls you closer, her licorice-whip hair wrapped around your gummy fin,
you grab hold of a bit of licorice and begin to chew through it.

"AAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH" the Sea Witch screams. "STOP THAT!"

Undeterred, you continue chewing (the licorice tastes awful, by the way),
until you have freed yourself. Frantically, you begin to swim away.
A now furious Sea Witch is chasing you, skimming through the marshmallow-water
much more quickly with her six (or is it eight?) octopus-like tentacles.

She swims closer and closer, her rapacious mouth hanging open,
ready to swallow you ...
