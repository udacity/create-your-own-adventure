You dive into the marshmallows and they part like water. Hey, it's your dream - "Do what you want" you 
think to yourself. To your delight you are joined by a pod of gummy dolphins chasing a school of 
silver pearls. The dolphins do not speak but you can sense their thoughts and you are comforted to 
learn that they accept you as one of their kind. You experience a sense of peace and belonging like 
you have never before known. 

Your euphoria is short lived though. In a flash the collective love of your pod is replaced with fear and anguish.
When you recover from the shock of your emotional 180 you find yourself alone.

A pain shoots up your legs. You glance down to where your feet should be only to see a single gummy 
flipper wrapped tightly in the ends of licorice whips.

You are trapped. Your dream is going horribly wrong. You have been ensnared by... 

... Ursula the sea witch!

She is enormous, with a mouth large enough to eat you in three bites! Her licorice-whip hair is 
wrapped around your flipper, and she begins to pull you towards her, reeling in the licorice like 
fishing line.

What to do!?
