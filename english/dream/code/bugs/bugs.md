As I sat down to my laptop, I noticed that the keys had been transformed into
little beetles with white glyphs marked on their black carapaces. My fingers
tapped down in their familiar rhythm, but the tiny black bugs scurried away
before any input could be collected.

And now I´m wondering if it´s a dream or a dream inside a dream, while the little bugs went together to form an unspeakable word!
