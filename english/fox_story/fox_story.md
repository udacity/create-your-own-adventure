Once upon a time lived fox in this world.

Fox was always sad and angry about everything.
Fox liked to keep his emotions inside his head.
Fox never was cruel or hard to deal with.
Animals around always used him for their selfish purposes.
Fox couldn't say 'No' to anyone.
Fox went home and tried to swallow all this sorrow he had.
Once he found an oil color tubes in the forest.
He made canvas from the web, abandoned by spiders.
He made palette from the big leaf fallen from the tree in autumn.
He made brushes from fallen tree branch and fur from his tale.
He found a nice flat rock to be his easel.
Then he sat in his burrow until the winter came.
Fox waited for the coldest day to see the starry night.
Fox came out of his burrow and breathed in fresh cold air.
The forest was silent and calm.
Fox took his color tubes, canvas, palette, brushes and went to the easel.
Fox didn't felt freezing cold, just peacefulness.
Fox put canvas on the easel, squeezed out out colors on the palette and began to paint.
This night stars were bright and glittering as never before.
It was hard for fox to hold brush with his ice-covered paws.
Tears on Fox's nose were frozen.
But he continued.
For Fox this was the the night which had more beauty than all his unhappy life.

Night went.
All the rest days of winter were cloudy and snowy.
In the spring all animals came out of their shelters to bask in the sunlight.
They gathered around the distant rock on the hill.
They were silence.
They watched on the starry winter night painting like through the window.
They shivered regardless the warm shining sun above.
They felt sorrow and regret, but non of them could explain why.

They never remembered Fox.
Nobody noticed his absence.
But since that time, every winter there was one frosty night, calm and silent, when stars glared and sparked on the sky.
But nobody could see it...
