You swipe the lighter off the floor as your hand shakes. You try feverishly 

to hide it in your pant pocket as the hand grabs wildly at your leg.

You look around nervously. An omnious feeling creeps in. You start to worry.
You place it carefully in you pocket and take a deep breath.  

The marshmallow hand scurries away and huddles in a corner of the room,

trembling.

The marshmallow returns from the corner and offers you a freshly rolled doobie.

(Being as you are currently in Colorado, and thus this action
is perfectly legal.)
