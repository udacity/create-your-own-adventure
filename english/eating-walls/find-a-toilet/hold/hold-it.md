You hold it.....forever......through the eons you hold. Through rain and snow. Through the rise and fall of empires. Through all this you continue to hold.

Finally, the world is going dark, the sun is finishing it's collapse in to a red dwarf. You continue to hold.....

In the end the earth is returning to it's formless state, dust orbiting in the ether.

You held it....forever.
