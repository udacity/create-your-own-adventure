You realise the hand on your shoulder is covered in slime and attached to an alien.

The three giant pupils staring at you shrivel into pinholes as the alien backs away.

The alien raises his arm, speaks into a device on his wrist, and disappears in a swirl of light.

"Really? A torch!? Who carries a torch around nowadays? What is this, 1992?"

An echo-ess voice says, "Be it 1992 then..." 

You're teleported to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday, October 24, 1992.

Bottom of the 11th 2 outs, Toronto is winning 2 to 1.  The alien appears and offers you a choice to
have a ticket with a placed bet for Toronto to win or Atlanta to win.
