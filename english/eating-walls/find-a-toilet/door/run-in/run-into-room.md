You run into the room and slam the door behind you! You don't know whose hand that was and you don't want to.

The room you're now in is cold and damp, about 10x10x10ft, and made of stone.  So much for marshmallows, huh?

There is an opening in the floor with a ladder going down and a lever on the wall to the right of the dark door.

And you see a window at the corner of the room suddenly.

Do you:
