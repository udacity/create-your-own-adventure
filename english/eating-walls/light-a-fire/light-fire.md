You've always known what to do when you encounter marshmallows. There is no better form of marshmallow than a toasted
marshmallow!

So, you reach into your pocket and bring out the matches to light a fire. With just a dozen matches, you think you can
toast enough marshmallows to make a door that you could eat and then fit through.  You set to work diligently,
starting from the the floor in the middle of one wall and working your way up.

Oh, the deliciousness! Toasted marshmallows are your absolute favorite treat.  You find that you can get a nice, golden 
brown at a rate of about two marshmallows per match.  As you begin to remove the toasted marshmallows from the wall, 
you can see glimpses of the other side.

Outside the marshmallow room, you can see that it is nighttime and everything is shrouded in darkness.  You realize you 
will have to decide whether it is safer to stay in side the marshmallow room or to venture outside.
