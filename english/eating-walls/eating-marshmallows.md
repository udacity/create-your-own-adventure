After taking more than a few bites, you start to feel sick.  You're not sure this was a
good idea.  On the other hand, it sure is tasty! In fact, you decide to eat even more marshmallows!

Sitting down next to the partially eaten marshmallow wall, your stomach begins to grumble, churn,
and babble. Hoping to walk off the uneasy feeling, you stand up. Upon standing up, your stomach
quiets and you entertain how to spend the rest of the day.

But wait!  Just when you when you were about to start contemplating, you suddenly feel torn between 
heading for the toilet or heading for the hills.  Either way, neither of your options look pretty.
