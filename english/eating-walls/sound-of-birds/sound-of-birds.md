You turn around and the marshmallow walls have disappeared! 
You remember that you have been stranded in a forest for some time. 
You are cold and hungry. Being so cold and hungry sure makes you miss 
those fluffy, yummy marshmellow walls... but over the sound of your 
grumbling tummy, you hear the sound of birds in the forest.
