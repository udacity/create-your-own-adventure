You decided to asked the marshmallow to watch your favourite movie Up with you.
Halfway through the movie, the marshmallow walks out.  
You change the TV to F-Troop and it comes back in and sits down.  
Turns out it loves Agarn!
You then change the channel to meet the press
Marshmallow gets even more fascinated

You change the channel to Casablanca, 
the marshmallow starts to cry.

As you watch him crying you also gets emotional and remember that summer day which started to rain and you rashly grabbed him and got under that big tree nearby, so you could protect him from get melted.
So easily you got lost in thoughts and you could help yourself to get a little tired, so you think:

 - Well, as Mr. Marshmallow seemed once again interested in watch TV, wouldn't be a problem sleep for a while after all. 

 [Would you allow yourself to fall asleep while he's distracted](memories.md) or [would you get a little closer to him to watch the movie together](../daredevil-marshmallows/daredevil-marshmallows.md)?
