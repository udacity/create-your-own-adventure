After you landed, you realized you were in a different land,
a land with giants, dragons, and mythical creatures known
as Skyrim. 

You realize you are standing in front of Whiterun and
decide to ask for help.

The guard tells you that he was an adventurer just
like you until he took an arrow to the knee.
