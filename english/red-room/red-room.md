Better safe than sorry. As you wish, you entered the red room.

  It's so bright, soft on the ground. 
  Looks like you are standing at a piece of cloud.
  Nothing else. But just a clock ticking. 
  Pointed to 12:00AM/PM

  Congratulations!
    You found heaven. 
    God wants to keep you by her side cause you are a good kid.
    Your choice reflects you are a cautious person.

  -Good End-
