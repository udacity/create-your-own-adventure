The hand of marshmallow is speeding towards you and growing as it approaches
. You start running away from it, but it seems that the walls are closing
 in on you. Suddenly everthing stops and dead silence ensues. You turn
around to take a look at the marshmallow hand and in a flash you are 
enveloped in a sea of marshmallow. Wherever you see, there is nothing but 
marshmallow. You flail and trash but to no avail. You cannot draw breath. 
You are suffocating! It starts getting dark to your eyes. 
There is no water near.

You jump up from the reverie and find yourself by a forest road with a 
bottle of pills by your side. You see a jeep crashed into the trees some 
distance away. The sound of distant gunfire reaches your ears and it dawns
on you that you are near the town of Impala.

Now stop fooling around and take your malaria pill. You've got to find the
jackal and put an end to this madness. How else do you think you're
going to complete FarCry 2. Huh?
