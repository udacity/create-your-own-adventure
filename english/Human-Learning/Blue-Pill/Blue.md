You made him take the blue pill
On taking the blue pill, Mark forgot who he was and felt threatened by 
the world around him. He gathered all his tools in his garage and went 
on to create a psuedo-hydrogen bomb to destroy the planet. 
He killed every robot in his world. 
He also made a ship that could travel faster than the speed of light to 
explore other planets to destroy the life there as well.
