You have entered into the world of a secret agent.
If you used to be a Drill Master, you should aspire to become 
a [White Tiger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linecorp.LGRGS) instead.

You have entered into the world of one of Her Majesty's secret agent.
Codename Agent 008; his name is Bond, Milton Bond.
He's the pencil pushing assistant of his more well-known cousin, [James](http://www.007.com/characters/the-bonds/).
While James is out stopping evil-doers, rescusing damsels in distress, and having the occasional martini.
Milton is responsible for making sure all of James' paperwork is in order.
Need the requisite form for a new Aston-Martin for that high speed car chase?
Ask Milton!
Special ordering a bespoke tuxedo for a fancy dinner and with a side of fisticuffs?
Milton's your man.
Need someone to send in your end of mission expense report, complete with TPS cover letter. 
Milton's already one step ahead of you.

Milton's great adventure began the day he got a call from James in the middle of the night.
A very large and powerful company had decided to rid the world of paper,
so that every single part of desk work would be automated. According to James, if they succeeded,
all secretaries, assistants, and clerks would lose their jobs to machines. How awful!!
The only way to stop them would be to write a very compelling letter to the Secretary of State. He needed
Milton to craft and deliver this letter or else...

It was a very risky mission and he could [shy away]() from the job and go ahead with his life. 

OR

He could [take on the mission](../MiltonsMission/MiltonsMission.md) and have a shot at saving the office-world
