Heisenberg is driving and the cop asks him "Do you know how fast you were going?"

"No, but I know exactly where I am" Heisenberg replies.

The cop says "You were doing 55 in a 35." Heisenberg throws up his hands and
shouts "Great! Now I'm lost!"

If you didn't get the joke, you probably didn't understand the science behind
it. If this is the case, it's a chance for you to learn a little physics.

According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, you cannot simultaneously
know both your position and speed precisely.  

The joke relates to a phenomenon of quantum physics that states that the more
precisely you can know the location of something, the less precisely you can
infer the speed. Thus, the fact that Heisenberg knew precisely where he was
implied that he could have no idea of the carâ€™s speed.

However when the cop tells Heisenberg exactly how fast he's going - he no
longer knows where he is and hence shouts that he's lost !
