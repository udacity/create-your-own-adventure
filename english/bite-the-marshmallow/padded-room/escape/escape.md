After a brief testing of your restraints you realize that when you shift your weight to your right side
you can wiggle your wrist in the restraints and might just make it free.
You notice the distant hum growing louder. 

You shift your weight, wriggle your wrist, and eventually your hand slides free from the restraints. 
You release your left hand and sit up, feeling dizzy but ready to run. You look
around and realize you have the option of running down the [staircase](stairs/stairs.md) 
to your right or heading down the [hallway](exit/exit.md) towards what looks like it might be an exit.
