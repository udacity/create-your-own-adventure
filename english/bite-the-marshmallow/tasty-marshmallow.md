Suddenly there is a horrible pain in your mouth! Who would have
thought marshmallows, so white, so innocent, could cause such
excruciating pain! But come to think of it, you've never gone
to the dentist about that root canal he recommended almost a
year ago, and perhaps you should have gone back instead of
trying to save a few bucks...

Wait a minute....how did you end up in this car?  You must be hallucinating
