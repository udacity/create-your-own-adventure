Just then you remember that you have access to a magical party bike! Cupping your hands around your mouth, you shout to nobody in particular, "Party Bike, take me away!". 

In a flash, a bright red bicycle appears in the room.  It is covered in lights that make a disco-ball pattern on the floor of the room. It has a garland of festive miniature flags draped in front of the handlebars. It is even playing party music! 

You hop on the seat and say, "Ok Party Bike, let's blow this pop stand!". As you put your feet to the pedals, the power of the Party Bike courses through you. You put your head down and crash through the nearest wall to the outdoors, Kool-aid Man-style. 

As rubble and debris fly everywhere, you let loose with a satisfying "OH YEEEAHHHH!". Now that you've performed an awesome feat, however, you have a new problem: your antics have attracted the attention of a cluster of marshmallow creatures!
