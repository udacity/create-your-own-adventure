"Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat,
bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves lifting weights in three
attempts. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt
format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became
standardized to the current three.

In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as 'raw' lifting or
'classic' in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or
squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not
un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting. Weight belts,
knee sleeves, wrist wraps and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing
equipped from un-equipped lifting.

Competitions take place across the world but mostly in the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom,
Iceland, South Africa, Poland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Russia, Taiwan, Japan and Ukraine. Powerlifting has
been a Paralympic sport (bench press only) since 1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport. Local,
national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently
of the IPF."

A very strict federation when it comes to powerlifting is the [IPF](http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/)

But instead of being strong, maybe you can use [alchemy](../alchemy/alchemy.md) to lift the weights!

The power is yours!
