The marshmallow man explains that he thinks the lighter will 
melt the walls of the prison so you can both escape. He says that 
the lighter will slowly melt the marshmallow, but you must not put it
too close to the wall. If the flame touches it, the wall will 
burst into flames and you will both be consumed in the inferno.
