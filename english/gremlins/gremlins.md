So you've got a gremlin and think it's so cute, right? Think again! Because if you fail to follow any of these rules you're in big trouble:

1. Do not expose it to sunlight, or any kind of white light. Light scares it!

2. Do not, under any circumstances, allow it to get wet, or it will spawn more little gremlins, and those won't be as cute as it, believe me!

3. However much it may cry or ask for it, DO NOT, EVER, EVER, EVER, feed it after midnight, or you'll be terribly sorry: you little cute gremlin will turn into an evil little monster!
