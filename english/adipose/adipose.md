You remember you took your diet pills before going to sleep.
The marshmallows are in fact your Adipose!
You die from fat drain.

You are absorbed into the marshmallow wall and now you wait with the others for new recruits.

You emerge from the wall a marshmallow human. You now resemble the Michelin man. 

As you ponder your place in the universe, you feel a slight fire under your
feet and begin to worry... "Am I a human dreaming I'm a marshmallow being
roasted alive, or am I a marshmallow being roasted alive who awoke from a dream that I
was a human?"

I must resolve this marshmallow dream.
