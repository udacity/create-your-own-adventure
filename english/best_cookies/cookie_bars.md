1/4 teaspoon table salt 
3/4 cup cold butter, cubed
3/4 cup toasted slivered almonds, coarsely chopped 
Vegetable cooking spray 

RHUBARB-RASPBERRY FILLING
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1 pound rhubarb or 1 (1-lb.) package frozen rhubarb, thawed, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
2 (6-oz.) containers fresh raspberries 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 

CREAM CHEESE BATTER 
2 (8-oz.) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Preparation

1. Prepare Crust: Preheat oven to 350°. Stir together flour and next 3 ingredients in a large bowl; cut butter into flour mixture with a pastry blender until crumbly. Stir in almonds. Press mixture onto bottom of a lightly greased (with cooking spray) 13- x 9-inch pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack until ready to use.

2. Prepare Filling: Stir together 3/4 cup granulated sugar and next 2 ingredients in a large heavy saucepan; stir in rhubarb and 1 container raspberries. Let stand 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla and remaining raspberries.

3. Prepare Cream Cheese Batter: Beat cream cheese and 3/4 cup granulated sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat just until blended after each addition. Add lemon zest and juice, beating well. Spread Rhubarb-Raspberry Filling over Crust. Gently spread Cream Cheese Batter over filling.

4. Bake at 350° for 25 to 30 minutes or until set. Cool on a wire rack 1 hour. Cover and chill 4 to 8 hours. Cut into bars.
