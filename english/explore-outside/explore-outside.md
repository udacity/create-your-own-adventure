Walking out of a hole created from gobbling marshmallows, you step into a
valley full of odd sights and sounds, each beckoning, suggesting mystery, but promising adventure.

to mind. The boat is thick enough for now. You are about to call to the child. But...

In the distance, you notice a tower that has caught fire, but is smoking a deep shade of purple.
