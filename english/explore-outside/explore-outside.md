Walking out of a hole created from gobbling marshmallows, you step into a
valley full of odd sights and sounds, each beckoning, suggesting mystery, but promising adventure. 

You see a yellow lake surrounded by towering blue trees. In the lake, there is a small green
child fishing in a marshmallow boat that's beginning to melt. But the child doesn't seem
to mind. The boat is thick enough for now. You are about to call to the child. But...

In the distance, you notice a tower that has caught fire, but is smoking a deep shade of purple.
A strange blue light seems to be eminating from the tower
making the flames look as though they are made of ice.
