As you approach the small, green child fishing in a marshmallow boat,
you realize that, indeed, the marshmallow boat is beginning to melt.

Since it is melting slowly, you have time to intervene.

Do you:

[return to the marshmallow room to eat more marshmallows because you no longer 
feel the need to help?](../../explore-outside/eating-marshmallows/eating-marshmallows.md)

[head now to the tower because you can see the child is safe in this one
foot deep lake?](./journey-to-flaming-tower/journey-to-flaming-tower.md)

[give the child your extra marshmallows to repair the boat?](./repair-boat/repair-boat.md)
