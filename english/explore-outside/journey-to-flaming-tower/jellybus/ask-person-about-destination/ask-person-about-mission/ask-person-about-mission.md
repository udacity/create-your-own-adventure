You decide to ask the KitKat-shaped guy about his special and mysterious mission.

He looks at you in a strange way that scares you. After a moment of tension, he tells you
about the mission. He is one of the most powerful warrior of Chocosnackland,
and he is supposed to save Toblerone princess, who has been kidnapped.

He reccomends you not to follow him to the castle.
