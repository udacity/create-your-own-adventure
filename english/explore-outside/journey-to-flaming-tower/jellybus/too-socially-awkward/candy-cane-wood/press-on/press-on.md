You press deeper into the wood.  The air is close and hushed here.  You feel like you're in a 
library.  Soon, you come to the very heart of the wood.  You feel the power surging through 
this place; ancient power, older than the oldest candy cane tree.  It has been here for a long 
time, seen civilizations rise and fall, trees sprout, grow tall, then die, and yet it remains, 
unaging, unchanging: the heart of the wood.  You gaze upon this sacred place.  What do you see?

[It is not for you to know.  I have visited the deepest grove of the candy cane wood, and seen 
what grows there; I am an initiate of the wood, knowing of her mysteries, privy to her arcana; 
I will keep her secrets.](keep-her-secrets/keep-her-secrets.md)
