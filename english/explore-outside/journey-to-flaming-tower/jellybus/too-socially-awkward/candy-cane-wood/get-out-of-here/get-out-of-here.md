You run back whence you came--or so you think.  But the oppressive candy cane wood seems only 
to grow thicker as you scramble.  You trip on a sour straw root and tumble to the floor.  As 
you struggle to rise you hear something approaching.  It's... it's...!

Just a peaceful sugar panda in search of some tasty bamboo pocky.
