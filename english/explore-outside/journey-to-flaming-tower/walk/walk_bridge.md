You finally arrive at the flaming tower! 
You are running out of drinking water and everything around you is in flames. 
Behind a crack in the flaming tower's door you can see a fountain.
Around you you see:
1) A dog tied to a flaming lamppost
2) A key on top of a flaming rock
3) A fire hydrant covered in flames

What to do?
