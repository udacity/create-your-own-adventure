While playing around with the saior's armor, you make a lot of noise and wake him up. 

He wakes up feeling extremely furious because he sees you wearing his armor, and also because you woke him up.

He tries to hit you, but suddenly at that moment, you feel as you've got super powers.

You make a spell, and then you re-lease a ball of fire which hits the sailor and makes him unconscious. 

However he wakes up after few seconds while being even more furious.

What do you do?
