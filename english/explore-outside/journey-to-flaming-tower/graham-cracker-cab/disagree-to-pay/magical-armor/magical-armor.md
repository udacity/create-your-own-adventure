You conduct a series of hand-seals and summon Ragnor's armor to protect you from the bone-melting flame from the tower.
You approach the door with your glistening armor and pick up a rock as your weapon.

You knock on the door and wait for the legions to answer your knock.

While waiting, you think that i might be a good idea use your philosopher's stone
to create some gold in case you need to bargain with the inhabitants instead
of fighting them with the rock.

The door swings open with an ominous sound, and three demons approach you.
One with a blue cloak (the demonacrat), one with a red cloak (the republicrat),
and one with a gray cloak (the independcrat).

Which do you use your gold to bargain with?
