Jumping in the greedy cab driver speeds you toward the burning tower.

Looking through your pockets you suddendly realize you don't have near enough to cover this ride.

You think about bailing out now, the ground here all appears to be based off of some strange
glucose structure, with a good tuck-and-roll you should be fine. Your looking out the window preparing
for your escape when you realize, your a huge p#### err... scaredy cat.

It's to late now your rolling up to the burning tower. You know you have to get away this marshmellow as
soon as he finds out you don't have his money. Then it hits you, THE FIRE... marshmellow melt!!

As the vechical makes the final approach you see the firefighters all dressed in their purple 
flame retardent suits, and just your luck there's an extra one sitting on the back of their truck.

The car stops and you throw the door open. Running full speed towards the firefighters you feel yourself
get hit in the back of the head with a heart, then star, now a horseshoe, clover, and baloon.

"What the..." you scream, turning back you see a small man in a green suit riding a rainbow. He holds out 
his hand chanting "Follow me! It's majically delicious"
