You muster up all of your courage and turn to face your pursuer.  Behind you in the grass is a small, adorable kitten.
It's big, brown almost cartoonish eyes stare up at you, drawing you closer.
The dread you felt running from this presence is still there, but the eyes beckon you ever closer.
You are powerless to resist. You have been eaten by a Grue. But luckily for you, Grues do not like
marshmallows so he spits you out.
