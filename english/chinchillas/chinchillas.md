Once upon a time, there were three chinchillas. The first one is called Mouse,
who is smart. The second one is called New Guy (NG), who loves to eat but
remains skinny. The third one is called Big Guy, who likes to escape.

At first Mouse bit off a finger from New Guy, and Big Guy bit off New Guy's
whiskers. But eventually, they all lived happily ever after.
