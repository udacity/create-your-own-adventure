You list the marshmallows in packages of 100 on ebay.  
A popup advertises a dessert courier service "Candy Couriers".
They sell like hotcakes.  How do you get the marshmellows to the buyers?

Do you:

Run quickly to [deliver them](./running-delivery/running-delivery.md)

[enlist Bezos's aerial drones](drones/drones.md)

[Look for an exit to try to deliver them by hand](../../find-exit/leave.md)
