You arrive at the Malo concert, certain that a bad pun was what the waitress meant by her cryptic clue.
You search the room for something, anything, that will give meaning to this story...

The music is horrible, and you die.

...

You wake up in your bed. It's sunday morning, and you mom has made you blueberry pancakes.
You eat them and get ready for church.
Man, dreams are weird!
