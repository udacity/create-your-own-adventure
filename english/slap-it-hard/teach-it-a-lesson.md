You look at the crass marshmellow man (woman?) and give it a cold, hard staredown.
	
	"You, yes you! How dare you think you can take my lighter, who do you think you are, hm?"

The Marshmellow being has a queer gaze in its eyes. But it's not looking at you.
It's looking at the lighter.

	"Ah, I see. Afraid I'll light up the whole place, are you? No, no, you must'n think that!" You say this with a bit of sarcasm, after all, this Marshmellow thingy can't possibly fathom sarcasm.

As if it's reading your thoughts, the Marsh-thingy springs forward, it's delicious little legs scrunching up to get more height. It's coming for you!

What do you do?
