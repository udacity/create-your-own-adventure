The Marshmallow creature has a look of determination (erm, if you can call a cute fluffy face that. It has more of a Chow Chow face, you know, those super kawaii puffy doggies that just melt your heart when they waddle around or munch on their little biscuits. :3 Yeah, I've always wanted one of those, but the fur...man, how does one deal with so much shedding?! Though, you will have a puff cloud that loves you beyond reason, becoming your best friend that goes with you everywhere and anywhere, heck yeah! Yeah...Ahem, I digress.) as it lunges toward you.

You take one step to the right and 'plop', it lands right next to you, bouncing ever so slightly near your feet. You inch closer to what should be its face.

	"Hmm, not much of a heart breaker, are you old boy? Nevermind, for your folly, I shall teach you a lesson here and hope that you will never do such a foolish thing again."

You fix your cravat (oh yes, you're dressed to the nines and quite frankly are disappointed that no one is here to admire your elegant stance or how you held your marble headed cane, a gift the king gave you after that party you threw a fortnight ago. Ah, what a ball. Only those who mattered, and knew how to strike up a good conversation on the latest fashion, were invited. Yes, a grand party indeed. You need to ask Mrs. Pearce to send invites for another...) and take off a glove...no, you put it back on, who knows what foul diseases the Marshmallow something has all over its plump body.

WHACK.

	"Hmm, perhaps another."

WHACK, WHACK.

	"Well, those were three slaps in all, don't you go about sniveling. But that should teach you a lesson to mess with me, the magnificient Leslie Howard!"
