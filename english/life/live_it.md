In every stage of life, you don't like the present stage you are in but feel the next stage is better or the previous stage was. 
But this stage you are living right now is the next stage which you earlier thought was better 
or it is this stage which you would say is better at a later point of time. 
Then why not realise the goodness of the present stage at that moment and live it happy?
