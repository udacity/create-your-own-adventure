Shri Swami Vivekananda says:


1. Education is not the amount of information that we put into your 

brain and runs riot there, undigested, all your life.

We must have life building, man making, character making assimilation of ideas.

If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character

you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library..




2. Bear in mind, my children, that only cowards and those who are weak commit sin and tell lies. 

The brave are always moral. 

Try to be moral, try to be brave, try to be sympathising. 




3. Have faith that you are all, my brave lads, born to do great things! 
Let not the barks of puppies frighten you -- no, 
not even the thunderbolts of heaven -- but stand up and work!




4. Know that every time you feel weak, you not only hurt yourself but also the Cause. 
   Infinite faith and strength are the only conditions of success.




5. Who is Helping You, Don’t Forget them.  
   Who is Loving you, Don’t Hate them .   
   Who is Believing you, Don’t Cheat them.

6. Anything that makes you weak physically, intellectually
   and spiritually,reject as poison. 

7. Talk to yourself at  least  once in a Day, Otherwise you may,
   miss a meeting with an EXCELLENT person in this World.

8. Relationships are more important than life,
   but it is important for those relationships to have life in them. 


9. You have to grow from the inside out. 
   None can teach you, none can make you spiritual. 
   There is no other teacher but your own soul.

10. Like me or Hate me,both are in my favor,
	  If you like me I am in your Heart,
	  If you hate me I am in your mind. 

11. BY the study of different religions we find that in essence they are one. 

12. Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him.
    In our own hearts and in every living being.


13. Fill the brain with high thoughts, highest ideals place them
	day and night before you and out of that  will come great work.

14. Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him ,
    In our own hearts and in every living being.
