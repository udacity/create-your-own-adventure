Excited to follow your dream, you excitedly run to the shore with handfuls of
reed, after spending your first half and hour making the most gorgeous basket
man had ever laid eyes upon you notice and unsettling calm in the water. Gazing
around you scan the horizon but see nothing ... until it is too late!

An alligater springs from the water and tears your weaving arm straight from the
socket, the worst part is the basket was never found.
