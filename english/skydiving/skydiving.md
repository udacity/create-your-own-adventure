And I went to an airport  and saw someone jumping out of a plane and open and parachute and though i must try that.

So I did.

It is on my to do list.

After I landed, I realized that this was great! I turned around and said "Let's do it again!"


I did it when I was 20.  I misunderstood the jump master and was hanging outside the plane for
longer than necessary.  I did not roll right away when I landed and felt a shock wave up my back.
Overall, it was great but I think I'll stick to skiing, rock climbing, scuba diving, and trying 
things like hang gliding.
