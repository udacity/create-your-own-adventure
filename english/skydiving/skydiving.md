And I went to an airport  and saw someone jumping out of a plane and open and parachute and though i must try that.

So I did.

I went inside the office to inquire about trying out skydiving.  They inform me that the next jump is
in 20 minutes and I am just in time to give it a go. The man behind the counter asks me why I'm interested in 
skydiving.

I reply...

It is on my to do list.

After I landed, I realized that this was great! I turned around and said "Let's do it again!"
