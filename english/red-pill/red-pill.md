An wrinkled old man with a funny hat appears and hands you a red pill and a glass of chocolate milk. 

You take the pill then drink the milk and within seconds you become extremely hungry but only for tacos.

However, you realize that there was much more to the red pill than 
expected. On top of craving tacos, you start seeing bizarre yellow glowing coagulating blobs floating everywhere. It might've been the [mushrooms in the chocolate milk](../mushroom/eat) or the combined effects of [the mushrooms and red pill](../the-truth).
