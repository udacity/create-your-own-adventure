#Golden Lab

You walk past a few dogs; one was sleeping, one was a little too aggressive, and one was just plain ugly. However, shortly you notice a beautiful Golden Lab. You immediately fall in love with him because you notice he's giving you a "can you believe this guy?" look while nodding his head towards a poodle in the corner. The poodle is wearing an umbrella hat.

There's only one problem. The girl at the counter says that the Golden Lab has recently been claimed, and is awaiting his new owner. You really have your heart set on this dog, and it seems like he likes you too.
