You walk down the tunnel and feel faint. You blackout and right before you hit the floor someone catches you.  


As you come to you are overwhelmed by the smell of marshmallow and stale booze.  The room is quite dark, 
but you are able to make out some writing on your hand.  It says "complete pull request"
You try to walk through the steps in your mind.  The voice in the room says 
you've been uttering the same words in your sleep for the past two days.
He advises you to wait until you're properly rested.  He says you don't want to end
up like the last person who screwed up their pull request.  

Do you wait and [go back to sleep](../go-back-to-sleep/go-back-to-sleep.md)

or
