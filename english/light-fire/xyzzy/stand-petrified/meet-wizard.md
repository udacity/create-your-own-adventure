You are frozen in horror as the dark figure approaches. All the icy breath of mortality
seems to emanate from the blackness under that woolen cowl.  

Now the figure stands before you. A bony hand moves up to throw back the hood,
revealing a stern-faced woman of unquestionable wisdom. "I am the wizard, Luxemburg the Red,"
she says. 

"N-n-nice to m-make your acquaintance," you politely stammer.

"I have come to offer you a place as an apprentice of the Spartacus League."

She points a long finger at the spot between your eyes.

"Before you choose, you must know that this will entail travel through time and space
to Berlin in the year 1898. Ponder carefully your future."

How will you choose?
