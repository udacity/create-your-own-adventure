You suddenly travel to Berlin 1989, lying on the road, at night (without wearing cloth!!).
but luckly, you find that you have some super power! You can control people's mind, easily 
you get some clothes and have a good night in a hotel. 

	When you wake up in the morning , numerous people gathered!! That's the day of tearing 
	down the Berlin Wall!!

	You run into those people...
