You start talking to the fish about what nice sunny weather it is outside.

All of a sudden, lightning strikes!

And the fish starts to wiggle in your hand, so strong that you can barely
keep hold of it. The fish reaches close to your face and sips off a small
piece of marshmallow that was stuck close to your lips from your earlier
feast.

After the fish swallowed the small bit of marshmallow, it calms down and
looks straight into your eyes, then it starts speaking:

-I was wondering, why did you catch me? Why did you pull me out of the
stream? I've been living there ever since.


What do you do next?
