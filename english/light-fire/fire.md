You light a small fire in the middle of the marshmallow room.

You stoke the fire by fanning the flames.

The higher the flames grow, the more you fan them.

As the fire grows, a sweet aroma fills the room and the ceiling becomes ever so slightly brown just above the fire.

This situation has the potential to go terribly wrong.

The walls around you begin to melt, globs of flaming marshmallow falling all around you. What do you do?

As you somehow avoid the globs of marshmallow using your reflexes, you notice a big enough opening in the melted 
walls for you to squeeze through.

But then you notice a rat entering that opening too.
