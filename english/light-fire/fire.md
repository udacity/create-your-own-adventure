You light a small fire in the middle of the marshmallow room.

You stoke the fire by fanning the flames.

The higher the flames grow, the more you fan them.

As the fire grows, a sweet aroma fills the room and the ceiling becomes ever so slightly brown just above the fire.

The walls around you begin to melt, globs of flaming marshmallow falling all around you. What do you do?
