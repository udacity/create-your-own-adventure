Using surplus graham crackers left over by the Wonka Construction crew, you begin to fill the pool with graham crackers.

You step onto the ad-hoc cracker flotilla and begin to surf away from the pool edge.

You notice a doorway ahead, if you can only make it to the far chocolate pool shore...

Do you...

Surf the crackers to the far shore?

Abandon the cracker-board and swim?

Panic.
