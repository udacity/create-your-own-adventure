As you strike a match, your suspicions are confirmed. The opening
that set you upon the path has disappeared.
The rat has scurried off the path into a dense forrest.
The forrest surrounds you and you see no way through.
You can see the path continue in both directons beyond your light source.
Ouch! your fingers burn as you drop the match.
What do you do?
