You picked up the sword, only to find the rat there to challenge you!

You try to fight, but you failed fencing in high school.

You're dead. 

The rat smirks as you sink into the unknown. 

However, a fairy appears to you. You're not really sure if you're dead 
anymore or if you are dreaming.

The fairy speaks to you.
