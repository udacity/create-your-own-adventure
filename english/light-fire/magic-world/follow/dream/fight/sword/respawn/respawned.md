...And you're back again.

The rat's smirk freezes in place. He wasn't expecting this.

It feels good to be alive again. You're already feeling more hopeful.

You might have failed at fencing in school, but this isn't some tired gym class with lame epees.

Your sword, Glamdring, is a worthy sword; and the rat, big as he is, is a worthy opponent.

The rat slashes at you with insane speed. You're fragged before you know it.

You die again. Too bad.
