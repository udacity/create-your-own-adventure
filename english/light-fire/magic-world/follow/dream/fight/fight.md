Looks like it was a bad dream. Good Morning!!

What a relief!

Apart from a splitting headache it appears that everything is normal. 
Just as you are about to breath a sigh of relief you notice that something seems to have been chewing on your pillows.
What is worse, that it may have been you. And why would they taste like marshmallows.

Wait you have a sword under your bed....
