You decide that - living as you do in an on-demand economy - you should be
able to get chocolate delivered within an hour or two.  

So you tap Amazon Prime on your phone, and order a bag of mini Hershey bars.

And, because you've lived and you've learned a little, you also order a six-pack
of water bottles. You glance around at the amount of marshmallow, and decide
you may need a few more bags of chocolate, plus several more boxes of graham
crackers. Feeling very strategic, you preemptively add Tums to the order, too.

1 hour and 59 minutes later, you and the delivery dude both agree that eating
4 Million calories (each) just may have been a poor life choice.
