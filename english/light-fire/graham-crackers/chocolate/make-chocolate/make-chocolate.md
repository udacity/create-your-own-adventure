You combine the cocoa and sugar with your own saliva and mix well.

You wait two weeks for it to set. It is extremely boring.

Finally, you place the newly-made chocolate bar on top of the graham cracker
and marshmallow.

You take a bite... of the greatest s'mores the world has ever seen!

It tastes like happiness. You devour it and start heading home, when you hear
a low growl. The aroma of the s'mores must have attracted someone... or
something... to your location!

You turn to run away but you are slowed by the chocolatey marshmallow goodness
that now fills your stomach.

You are eaten by a grue.

You die...
