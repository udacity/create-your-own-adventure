Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can
Spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies
Look out, here comes the Spider-Man.

Is he strong? Listen bud, he's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead
Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man.

In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime
Like a streak of light he arrives just in time.

Spider-Man, Spider-Man, friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man
Wealth and fame, he ignores, action is his reward.

To him, life's a great big bang up, whenever there's a hang up, 
You'll find the Spider-Man!
