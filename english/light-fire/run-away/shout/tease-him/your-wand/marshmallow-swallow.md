As this child's final act of self-defense, as he transforms into a giant marshmallow he extends forward and engulfs you.
Inside a marshmallow yet again, you roll down the hill and crash into the flaming marshmallow room you had just escaped.
Having been completely swallowed, there no air and only thick blackness.

You go unconscious, hopelessly fighting to escape.  The marshmallow becomes hotter and hotter... 
You do not awaken.
