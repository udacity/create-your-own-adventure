# Moving to Boston

"This city is the life! Though now that I'm here, I think I'll take a vacation..."

...or on the second thought, I'll put on a coat, stop being a sissy, and get to work!

I'm very lucky to live in the Avalon 
Back Bay apartment complex, it is not 
only very close to Copley Square, but 
it is also inside a shopping mall!!
