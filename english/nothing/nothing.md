You stare expectantly at the doctor, not sure what to say.
He walks slowly towards you with his hands still hidden.

Suddenly, two guards enter the room and quickly charge your way.
They have you pinned to the ground before you know it.
The doctor is now crouched down next to you.
He reveals a syringe from behind his back.

As he injects the flourescent green fluid into you, he says,
"I'm sorry it has to be like this, but you know..."

His voice fades away as you drift into unconsciousness.
