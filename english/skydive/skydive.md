You jump from a plane and plummet towards the earth. 

Never before have you felt this alive. Time slows down

and you begin to notice things you have never before 

considered. Like the many different types of clouds. 

You see large, fluffy, white ones, tall, forboding, dark

ones and whispy, phantom-like ones. Your existential 

angst slowly subsides as you become one with the clouds

and completely at the mercy of the law of gravity pulling

you towards earth. You let go of all those silly little

problems that have cost you much sleep and left you as empty 

as the answers you seek. That co-worker who always got on

your nerves for no particular reason. Only now you know

the reason because it is as clear as the blue sky above you.

He represents something you fear you are not. However, now

you realize you not only measure up to him but you also 

have potential far beyond what you've allowed yourself

to understand. The sky is the limit. Having reached this 

realization, you pull the string and float on air. You life

is no longer in freefall. Moving forward is as effortless

as floating in the direction of your choosing. And when you

land, the ground beneth you never felt so solid.
