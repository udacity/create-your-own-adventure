Recently I visited a zoo in my hometown. It was an awesome experience to be part of the
nature. I saw a lot of tigers, elephants, deer and a whole lot of other [animals](../animal/animal.md)

I was pretty thirsty. There is a lemonade stand over there.
I head over and buy some [lemonade](../drink/lemonade/lemonade.md)
