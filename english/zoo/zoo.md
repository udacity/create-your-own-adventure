Recently I visited a zoo in my hometown. It was an awesome experience to be part of the
nature. I saw a lot of tigers, elephants, deer and a whole lot of other [animals](../animal/animal.md)

I was pretty thirsty. There is a lemonade stand over there.
I head over and buy some [lemonade](../drink/lemonade/lemonade.md)

I choose to get better at [English](../get-better-at-english/english.md)

After my self trolling is complete, I decide to drink the lemonade.
As I lift the lemonade to my mouth I see the tigers have broken loose.

Suddenly I wake up, sheer panic reverberates throughout my body as the thought of being hunted by tigers begins to dissipate - it was only a dream. I reach for my glasses and take a sip of some water. I walk over to the window and look outside - and then I notice it. The water tastes sweet...lemonade. I look outside - there are [tigers everywhere](../tiger-attack/tiger-attack.md).
