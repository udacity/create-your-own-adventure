Your spell worked, and the door opens.  Thank god for crappy fork-wrapped-in-rope wands. Now free of the confines of 
the marshmallow room you run outside.

As you step through the doorway you are momentarily blinded by a bright light.  As your eyes adjust to the light 
outside the room you see...

That you are about to be crushed by a giant corn. :)
