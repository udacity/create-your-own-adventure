You throw yourself down between the wheels as the jumbo jet comes
 to a halt cushioned by the marshmallow room.  As you are dusting
 yourself off, emergency slides deploy from the airplane.  First 
person off is a princess, with her crown slightly askew.  She 
spots you and asks “Do you know how to share files on GitHub?”  
You can only nod silently.  She links her arm in yours, and off 
you stroll into the sunset.
