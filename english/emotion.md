French, English, Czech... These are all languages of rationality, languages of the superconsciuos - used to label and 
identify phenomena of the natural world. Love itself is not a language in that sense, instead love is that very 
phenomenon which we struggle so much to communicate adequately through these logical, rational constructs of language.
So ephemeral, so indefinite is love, that to see it as a language itself requires pushing the limits of human 
abstraction. Like envisioning the shadows of higher dimensions, love brings forth a pervasive force throughout the 
universe. We can try to encapsulate this force with words - poetic verse comes close, offering glimpses of insight 
which we can only evauluate with our basest instincts.
