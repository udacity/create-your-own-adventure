Score! Your friend won tickets to Game 7 of the World Series and invited you!

Being a lover of the ["lovable-losers"](http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs), you know your Cubbies won't let you down!

So which pitcher will the Cubs trust to take down the dreaded Yankees?

Of course! It's that [new guy](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/32106/jose-quintana) that they got from the White Sox!

With Quintana at the helm, it's time to [start](ninth/ninth.md) the game at [Wrigley Field](http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/ballpark/)!
