You're finally near the end of the course, but your mind is mush. Trying 
to find meaning in this crazy dream is too much.  You start to zone out.

You think about information inhabiting the circuits of your brain, like a
virus. ([It's the MEMES!](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_on_dangerous_memes?language=en))

You consider the implications of [wave/particle duality](https://youtu.be/Q_h4IoPJXZw)
and that makes you think of [Schroedinger's Cat](../shrodinger-cat/shrodinger-cat.md). ([and here])(https://youtu.be/IOYyCHGWJq4)

You consider the [nature of identity](../nature-of-identity/nature-of-identity.md)

You realize you're thinking too literally.  Perhaps this is a [dream within a dream](../dream_in_dream/inception.md)!

You accidentally enter another [dimension](../dimensions/dimension.md).
