You have arrived in a land full of ... well Big Nosed Bugs.
They have very small oblong bodys and spindly legs, but very large oblong noses.
You cannot figure out how they are able to stay upright.

They approach you and they all surround you and sniff.
Then suddenly they grin and you see them all rising slowly in the air but now you are too.
They carry you into the clouds and across the land and drop you near a large tree.
