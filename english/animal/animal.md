My worst fears have come true.  My cat is crying out for food.
The screams are the worst sound Iâ€™ve ever heard in my life.

Even if it really starts to cry, it's the same to me ... no food.
The hilarious thing is that i start thinking about making it my own meal.
I remember my last meal, oh it was a tiny chimichanga 3 days ago.
We are moving to the edge of eating our own shoes.
I've heard that it tastes like jerky...

I wonder what the cat would do if I gave it a hot dog. I know
what I would do.

I'd eat it. Yup, I know it sounds disgusting, but hot dogs are a national
treasure.

My hunger seized hold of my imagination. I found I was dreaming of a fantastical
 Candy Land. Trees were made of chocolate bark and gum drop leaves. The clouds
were floating marshmallows in the sky. I walked on a road of Jolly Ranchers down
a neighborhood of gingerbread homes. I dug my hand into the peanut butter ground
along the road. It all felt so real.
