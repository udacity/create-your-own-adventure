My worst fears have come true.  My cat is crying out for food.

Even if it really start to drop tears or weep blood, it's the same to me ... no food.
The hilarious thing is that i start thinking about making it my own meal.
I remember my last meal, oh it was a dead dog 3 days ago.
We are stepping to the verge of eating each other, human flesh oh what does it taste.
