Dreadnought implodes,
Rebels escape briefly,
Rae shines again.

Luke is a hermit, with a forgotten purpose,
Wookies like chicken,
Don't forget to fill up before long journies.

Casinos attract the rich, poor and conniving,
Stun guns hurt
Never leave the safety off a lightsaber

Pricess Leia inspires,
Snoke should moisturise,
Let the force be with you.

What next?

[Eat pizza] (../pizza/pizza.md)

or

[Sing Karaoke] (..karaoke/nope.md)

or

[Be happy] (../happy/happie.md) 

Maybe all of the above? ;-)
