After reciting your magic spell to open the door, you then realize you are not Hermione Granger, 
in fact you are no wizard at all. Upon realizing this demoralizing truth you take a moment to ponder your situation,
"Alas! I may not be a wizard but I ain't afraid of no ghost nor a marshmallow!" you say aloud after having the epiphany 
that you are indeed a ghost-buster! Your proton pack then materializes right in front of you.
