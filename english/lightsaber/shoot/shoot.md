Sadly, you don't possess enough midi-chlorians to make you truly strong 
with the Force. You'll have to leave that fancy weapon behind 
and go with what you've got.

As you clamber awkwardly out the other side of the goo, 
you hear a smug voice:

"Koona t'chuta, Solo?"

Agh. You knew you couldn't outrun him. You just didn't think 
he'd find you here.

"Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I'm trying to get out of this freaky 
marshmallow house. Tell Jabba I've got his money."

"Soong peetch alay!"

And then he says some stuff you don't understand without subtitles, 
but you get the gist of the message, so you reassure him: "Yeah, 
but this time I've got the money."

He tries to bribe you, thinking you'd be desperate enough to hand him 
the payment (even if you really did have it) right here, outside 
a melting mansion. You chuckle patronizingly. "I don't have it with me. 
Tell Jabba - "

But he cuts you off and insults you, and now you're seriously annoyed. 
Your left leg is still inside the collapsing candy house, for pete's 
sake! You're in a weird lunging position affording no mood to be 
humoring a third-rate galactic bounty hunter. Trying to reach for your 
holster, you grumble: "Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had 
a choice?"

He says something about Jabba again, a name he regularly uses 
to threaten you with bodily harm. Or even worse: to threaten 
the Falcon with bodily harm. You growl, "Over my dead body!"

He is so self-satisfied he thinks you've given him the punchline. 
That's the idea, he retorts. He's been looking forward to this 
for a long time.

You reply, "Yes, I'll bet you have."

Do you:

Shoot first?

Wait until he shoots, and then shoot back with better aim?
