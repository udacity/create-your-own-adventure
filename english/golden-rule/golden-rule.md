"Treat others how you want to be treated". 

You snap awake to the consuming realization that the golden rule is 
sustained by its sacrosanctity, not its merit, and your guilt for questioning 
its validity dissolves.

Unwrapping the proverb, you find its true function not in promoting peace, but 
in pardoning our obligation to understand one another. 

It is a wolf in sheeps clothing, and only a doppleganger for the more accurate:

"Treat others how they want to be treated"
