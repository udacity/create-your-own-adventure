You're confident that you can do better than any of those pitiful fools
running from the marshmellow monsters. With all your might behind you,
you ram into the door. The only results are the sound of a bang, and pain
in your shoulder. "Damn, what now..."

After 4 more tries and out of blind desperation, you try the door handle. 
To your astonishment, the door opens without a fuss. "Didn't I already try the handle...?"

Out into the day and the madness still ensues. You feel a sense of boldness
creeping into you. "I think I can do this..."

Do you [charge the nearest marshmellow monster?](../charge-a-marshmellow/charge-a-marshmellow.md)?

Or do you [flee away from them](../flee-marshmellows/flee-marshmellows.md)?
