... then you walk trhoug looking for a real option that make you finish
your work... trying to avoid any suspicion. Then you see a new door. One that recognize and you know it can be fun... you don't know WHAT IS AT THE END... so you enter the breaking bad door ...
When you read the warning ... then you feel a horrible pain... you shake your head and run screaming from there... thinking in how you can  kill the one who's create it.
