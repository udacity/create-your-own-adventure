You roll... 3...15...12...11...8...19!  Ooh, so close, almost a critical.
Nevertheless it's good enough to hit the Cacode..err...Beholder.
You deal 2d6+3 damage!

The Beholder takes a serious hit, but it's not enough to take him down.
He begins to charge at you with what is sure to be an attack strong enough to end your
campaign. Suddenly a mysterious portal opens that could lead to anywhere.

Do you take your chances against the [Beholder](../Beholder/Beholder.md)?
Or do you jump in to the [portal](../Portal/Portal.md)?
