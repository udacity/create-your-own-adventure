You roll... 3...15...12...11...8...19!  Ooh, so close, almost a critical.
Nevertheless it's good enough to hit the Cacode..err...Beholder.
You deal 2d6+3 damage!

Now, it's the Beholder's turn... 
It fires its eye lasers at you, but they all miss!
All except one, that is. Take 8 damage.

Your turn again, brave adventurer... What do you do?
