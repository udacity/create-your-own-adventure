You roll... 3...15...12...11...8...19!  Ooh, so close, almost a critical.
Nevertheless it's good enough to hit the Cacode..err...Beholder.
You deal 2d6+3 damage!

Your rogue scoffs, out of character, about how that'd be a critical if he rolled it.
This dude has been a pretty consistent thorn in your side since this campaign started.
Not that you're too worried about it, you are Lawful Evil after all, and you have a devious plan...
