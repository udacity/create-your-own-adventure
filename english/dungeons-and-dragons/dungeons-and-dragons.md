You roll... 3...15...12...11...8...19!  Ooh, so close, almost a critical.
Nevertheless it's good enough to hit the Cacode..err...Beholder.
You deal 2d6+3 damage!

Meanwhile, your good friend Al (IT'S AEOFEL!) falls into an acid pit. Despite
rolling 19 after 19 after 19, it looks like the DM has decided to be crule. It
would appear Aeofel is incapable of climbing from his sticky, burning fate.
