You continue to sing to keep the monster's hand at bay.

The power of your song is quite something to behold.

How long can you keep this going?

You must really work out that larynx.

Do they call you the Iron Lung? Because they should.

You start to feel something in your throat.

You start to think about marshmallows, and s'mores,
and that prompts you to sing [campfire songs](campfire_songs/rootbeer_song.md).

Or, you worry about that funny feeling in your
throat and quickly stop singing instead.
