You sing:

(Dough) – I use to buy my root beer,
Re (Ray) – The guy who pours my root beer,
Mi (Me) – The guy who drinks my root beer,
Fa – A long way to the bathroom,
So – Let’s have another root beer,
(La) Lots and lots of lovely root beer,
Ti (Tea) – No thanks, I’m having root beer,
And that’s why I have no
 dough, dough, dough, dough.

Everyone laughs, and the tension is diffused.
