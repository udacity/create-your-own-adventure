You try to remember another song that the monster may like better. 

Aha, you say to yourself as you figure out the perfect song.

Once again, you clear your throat and begin to sing Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up".

As you sing, a smile grows on the monster's face and you both begin to dance.

His hand holding yours is not as soft as you expected. It is cold and slightly compressed; you can feel the grooves on his skin where his flesh shrunk and puckered.
