You look sullenly back at the Mr Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and then
petulantly shove the remaining chocolate into your mouth.

He smiles and with horror you notice that your arms are beginning
to go white and are inflating like marshmallow.

Your thoughts evaporate and all you can think is about soft
fluffy sugar and why the Marshmallow Man seemed to think it was
so funny.
