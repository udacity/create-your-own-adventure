It's been a long and tiring 2 years for Leo. He's had quite enough of his current job. Not only is the pay bad, he doesn't even remember how he got there in the first place.

He stares at his screen again and considers his option.

That's it!

[He's going to be a teacher](noble-job/job.md)!

[He's going to get a sandwich instead](get-food/food.md)...
