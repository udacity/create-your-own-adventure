Hey there person :) 

How are you? how's life treating you? Are you worried that you might not amount upto something? do you feel that you don't have what it takes to achieve? Well, it happens that you might be right. But, that doesnt matter. Do your thing man, be content. you will die one day and one for the last time someone will think about you for the last time. Pretty upsetting huh? It's okay, accept it and own it. Now tell me, is that break up hurting you still? is that failed interview haunting you? No, I hope. Your problems are insignificant compared to the beautiful universe we live in. We all have but one life, lets just have some fun and leave forever huh? So go out there and ask that girl out, leave your shitty job, live life like its the last time, cause it is.
