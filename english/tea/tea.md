Ummm...

Such a nice cup of tea. Just a little milk. No sugar. Perfect.

Now, you think to yourself...

"What I need is a link." But, to where?

Maybe a to [China](to_china/to_china.md) in a journey through time and history
to learn about the legends of invention and spreading of this more than
millenary beverage.

Or maybe to [the United_Kingdom](to_uk/to_uk.md) to discover the British tea
culture and the tradition of the worldly famous five o'clock tea.
