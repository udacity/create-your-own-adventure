"That't the most ginormous beehive I've ever seen! It's just oozing out
honey by the bucketful!" you exclaim while pointing behind the bear.

"Oh my! I've not seen a beehive in years!" says the bear.

At the very moment the bear turns around to look, you dash through the
door and lock it tightly behind you.

Upon examening your surroundings, you find a very well maintained porta-
potty. You quickly relieve youself. With nowhere you go you realize that
you must exit the room and confront the bear.

However, after exiting the room you see the bear sitting and happily
licking his paws from all the honey that he just ate. The bear turns 
to you and says "Are you done in there? I've got to wash my paws."

What is your response?
