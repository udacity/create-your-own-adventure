Those eyes belong to the face of a bear and what a bear.  Nine feet tall
and all muscle.

As you stand there shaking in you boots the bear speaks and asks "You
going to be in there long?

I have to use it too. I can bear-ly hold it in!"

[Inform the bear that you've had one too many marshmallows](too-many-marshmallows/too-many-marshmallows.md)
