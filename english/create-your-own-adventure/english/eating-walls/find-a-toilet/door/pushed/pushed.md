A tall thin man in jester's motley stands before you.
He sighs and lights a cigarette.

You look down and realize you have just wet your
britches.  

The man looks at you and riggles his fingers in the air
like he's really spooky.

"HAH! Skiddish are ya? Well, too late to show you to
the restrooms..."

You are slightly embarrassed but happy to not be
holding it in anymore.

The man takes a long drag from his cigarette, 
promptly turns you to face the open door, and 
shoves you through the door. 
 
You wake up in bed having wet yourself.
