Do not mistake my yawn.
It is a silent scream for coffee.

The bitter-sweet flavor of roasted coffee beans invigorates your soul.

You feel like a new person. Like you have been reborn.

Nothing like a cup of coffee to start your day when you wake up.

Can you feel the caffeine rush inside of you? It's taking hold, controlling you. You're so high.

You settle into the table for a good long drink before you consider your next steps.

After having your coffee do you want to:

[Have another cup of coffee?](another-coffee/another-coffee.md)

[Or better, have a cup of tea?](drink-tea/drink-hot-tea.md)

[Write a caffeine-fueled full-length novel?](novel/full-length-novel.md)

[Go skinny dipping?](nude-run/nude-run.md)

[Light a Fire?](../light-fire/fire.md)

[Remenisce?](../remenisce/better-times.md).

[Bake yourself something sweet to go with this delicious brew?](cookie/bake-cookies.md)

[Start eating the walls?](../eating-walls/eating-marshmallows.md)

[Eat a Bagel?](bagel/eat-a-bagel.md)

[Book a Flight to Paris?](Paris/fly-to-paris.md)

[Go for a run?](Run/run.md)

[Play Chess?](chess/chess.md)

[Procrastinate?](procrastinate/procrastinate.md)

Coffee creates a great medium for people to have conversations about ideas and visions.
