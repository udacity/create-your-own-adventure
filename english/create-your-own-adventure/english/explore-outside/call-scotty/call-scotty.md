You feel inside your pockets and, suprisingly, you find a Starfleet communicator.

You flip it open, press the send button and say "Beam me up, Scotty!"

As you are about to beam up, you see a rocket firing at a ship.  You just hope its not the one you're beaming up to....

...then you recall that Scotty is Captain Kirk's new cat, not the faithful captain or engineering.
Cats have not yet evolved enough to operate transponders.
Perhaps you'll be safe from the intergalactic
wars after all on Planet 0-999-999...
