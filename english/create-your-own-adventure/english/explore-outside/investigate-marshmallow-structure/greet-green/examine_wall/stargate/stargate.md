You daintily step through the wall.
It offers some resistance as you pass through it, like a tasteless jello.
You look up inside the tower when you pass through the other side.
The walls are covered in guitars, violas, mandolins, of every shape and grain.
Their strings interweave and lace together throughout the entire tower, 
creating a harmonic spider-web the obfuscates your view of the top floors.
You step forward, and your footsteps resonate throughout the entire wall-mounted orchestra, 
a suprised melody at first, then an irritated  refrain.
The closest bass notes to you lasso around your limbs
and begin to hoist you towards the the top of the tower.
