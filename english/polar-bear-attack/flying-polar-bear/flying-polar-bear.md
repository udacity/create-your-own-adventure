You understand that it's difficult to wake up from a dream if you think this is all really happening to you.
You attempt to point out things that are around you that cannot possibly occur in real life... 
but wait, this is all so familiar.
It's like someone just like you was in a place just like this one once or twice before.

You realize that it was you and it is now and you fly off with the bear to meet the dancing lights to the north.
