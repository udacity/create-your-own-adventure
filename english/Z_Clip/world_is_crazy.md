How can a world that can produce a repository like this be allowed to continue? You tremble at what you now know you must do. You login into the GitHub servers using credentials you stole from Brent Beer (whom you had ensared in a clever phishing attack a few weeks back). A bead of sweat rolls down your forehead as you begin to delete repositories... as you begin to delete everything. As the create-your-own-adventure repository is purged from the server's memory, your experience an odd sense of weightlessness. The world begins to fade... to gray... and then to black... and then there is nothing.
