Sit in a comfortable position in which you could stay for a long period of time with ease. Set a timer for the amount of time you would like to practice so you can practice without distraction. Close your eyes and focus on the quality of your breath. Allow any other thoughts or feelings to pass through your focus as they come and then return your focus to your breath. Then your focus may become nothing at all, not even your breath. If thoughts or feelings arise again, return to your breath. When timer ends, take a moment to reflect on how you felt before, during, and now after. Find gratitude for your practice and then return to your daily life extending this feeling to all. Namaste.
