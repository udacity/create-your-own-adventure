The mallow man seems nice so you chat to him after walking up to him.

He decides he likes you too, so he gets out his Lego's.

He's got Star Wars, Lego Movie, space, technics, oh so much lego and you play with it all!

I wish they had Pokemon lego too.

Not to mention Harry Potter!

After a while he starts to get a bit too much, he doesn't get out much, you're bored.

You look around wondering what to do.

What would Jesus do?

What do you do next to stimulate and excite you!

But you ought to be careful, the power of the legos is not a joke!

You see, there are two types of legos in this world. 

We all know and  love them lego brand legos, any other brand belongs in the trash heap. IMPOSTERS
