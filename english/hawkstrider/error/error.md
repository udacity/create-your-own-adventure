"Oh, traveler!  You seem to be unfamiliar with these birds.  They are quite friendly to strangers if you
know how to speak Thalassian.  Some bird whisperer also gave me a long lecture of speaking "hawkstrider".
She said "Hawkstriders always sing in harmony, each taking turns to fill in their two note melody.  If a
sound is missed, the next will fill in the missed note."  I hope this is of some use to you."
