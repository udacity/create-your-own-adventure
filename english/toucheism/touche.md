In life we all crave attention and some put it in one word "love,"

To have a profound impact on someone psychologically, emotionally, 
and spiritually...

Well I call that toucheism. The ability to touch someone's life without 
necessarily physically connecting.

Like the feeling you get watching a slow roasting marshmellow; thinking 
of it melting in your mouth. 

A little bit of touche, would do a lot of good for our world.

Let's all aim to touch a life positively at every contact. 

Now how are you going to do that?

with [food](../marshmallow.md) that cure the soul?

with [possitive reinforcement](../amnesia/amnesia.md)?

with beautiful [music](../dance/dance.md) that heal the mind?
