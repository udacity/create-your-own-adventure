  --- Sense and Senility ---

The Bashwood family had been displaced from the opulent, Gothic-splendor of 'Ptarmigan Towers,'
and compelled to swallow their pride and live in somewhat reduced circumstances, 
suffering the rustic squalor of 'Crumbling Cottage' a damp and dilapidated habitation, in the midst of Dartmoor.
This unfortunate change in family circumstances had been felt most deeply 
by the three unfortunately unmarried Bashwood boys who, due to change in circumstance, 
and an unfortunate affliction of apathy and indolence, were compelled to still live at home with their parents.
The new Bashwood habitation was tragically isolated from eligible female companionship 
and impracticably distant from the nearest boozer. 
So the desperately lovelorn Bashwood boys could not even seek companionship in a common alehouse.

One particularly damp and miserable day, as rain battered the creaky casement windows of 'Crumbling Cottage,' 
Mrs Bashwood entered the parlor and was occasioned to address Erick, her youngest son, 
who lay lounging indolently on the sofa, ardently engaged in an internet computer game.

"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man, in possession of a computer controller, 
must be in want of a wife," announced Mrs Bashwood, with irritating sensibility.

"I'm way too busy to get engaged Mama," said Erick, clicking the buttons 
and woggling the stick of his computer controller, "and anyway, isn't that from the wrong novel?"

"Your father can't keep his job at the burger van for ever!" said Mrs Bashwood, "He should've retired years ago! 
Did you know he is having to lie about his age now? It's a competitive business, with all these young graduates."

"I might consider the possibility of a lucrative marriage Mama. Perhaps a computer analyst..... 
I suppose I could do with some cash - my computer controller's on the blink."

"Can't you at least change out of your pyjamas, Erick?
Your father will be back home from work soon, and with both your brothers still abed and all!"

"Oh bog! Now what you've gone an made me do, Mama - the whole dungeon party has died!"

"Oh I despair Erick. Isn't it about time you stopped playing those silly computer games and got yourself married? 
You are sixty seven, after all."
