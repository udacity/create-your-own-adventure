As you try come up with ideas for a new type of music you find that your fidgity, unfocused, and your concentration should be spelled CHAOS. 
You continue to struggle and pace around the room for weeks getting no where.
It's been this way all of your life. School was a disaster that you despised daily.
College was a complete struggle.
You contact your doctor and after months of review, appointments, and tests you finally have the answer for all those years... Undiagnosed ADHD!
Unfortunately, the diagnosis came too late and you've lost your job because of your 
obsession to make new music that never got off the ground.
