**Axe**: A strength based hero. General of the Red Army, Mogul Khan is also the sole survivor, *and conquerer* of these former legendary warriors. Using a demanding call, he provokes nearby enemies, drawing their attention and violence. This empowers Axe, however, as he channels the rage of his foes, his axe is swung effortless through rock, steel and flesh alike. This shear hunger for battle leaves his enemies stricken, and reveals a moment of weakness that gladly exploits with a powerful over-head swing of his axe. 

*abilities: Berserkers Call, Battle Hunger, Counter Helix(passive), Culling Blade*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Phantom Assassin**: An agility based hero. Even though being small and delicate might seem to many to be a disadvantage, Mortred uses this to be the very demise of her foes. In the *blink* of an eye, she can elegantly devistate her enemies with rapid strokes from her twin-blade, while her nimble figure allows her to evade several direct attacks with ease. Aiming for vital tendons and arteries, she will often end her opponents suffering with a merciful strike. 

*abilities: Stifling Dagger, Blink Strike, Blur(passive), Coup de Grace(passive)*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Invoker**: An intelligence based hero. A powerful wizard, wise and cunning. Able to manipulate the elements to his liking, Carl the Invoker posesses more talents than most. Those who wish to continue their lives, usually stay clear out of his way. 
*"My mind is a beacon of knowledge, blazing out across a black sea of ignorance!"*

*abilities: Quas, Wex, Exort, Invoke; QQQ=Cold Snap, QQW=Ice Walk, QQE=Ice Wall, QWE=Defeaning Blast, WWW=EMP, WWQ=Tornado, WWE=Alacrity, EEE=Sun Strike, EEQ=Fire Spirits, EEW=Chaos Meteor aka "the Meatball"*
