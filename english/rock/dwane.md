"Haven't I seen you in a movie or something?"

"Yes, I am a famous actor" the rock says. I am known as Rock "The Dwane" Johnson. 

You ask "The Dwane" for its autograph. It whips out a hammer and chisel and carves its signature into a piece of
paper, and hands it to you.

Some would probably call this experience surreal, but you you find the whole thing to be nonsensical and stupid,
[so you leave the rock and go back to the story](../marshmallow.md)
