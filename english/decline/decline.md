You stare at the countless paths ahead of you, each an unknown possibility of failure.

Looking from path to path, you start to spin as your head does the same. With every possible action, a preview plays in your head of predicted negative outcome.

You collapse to the ground. 

Sitting with your eyes closed, you see your unavoidable demise awaiting your first move.

You don't.

As you sit, you witness player after player starting the game, vanishing beyond the horizon, never to be seen again.

In this timeless void, you sit for eons..

A voice breaks the silence. You look around but can see no one. You try to detect the origin of the sound, yet it is all around you.

The voice continues....

"A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?"
