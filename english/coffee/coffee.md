Do not mistake my yawn.
It is a scream for coffee.

Drink some coffee and relax yourself a little bit.

The bitter-sweet flavor of roasted coffee beans invigorates your soul.

You feel like a new person after a cup of coffee.

Can you feel the caffeine rush inside of you?

After having your coffee do you want to:

[Have a nice nap?](nice-nap/nice-nap.md)

[Have another cup of coffee?](another-coffee/another-coffee.md)

[Or better, have a cup of tea?](drink-tea/drink-hot-tea.md)

[Write a caffeine-fueled full-length novel?](novel/full-length-novel.md)

[Go skinny dipping?](nude-run/nude-run.md)

[Light a Fire?](../light-fire/fire.md)

[Remenisce?](../remenisce/better-times.md).

[Bake yourself something sweet to go with this delicious brew?](cookie/bake-cookies.md)
