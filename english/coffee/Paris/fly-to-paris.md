You got off the AirFrance flight into Charles De Gaulle Airport. Everyone is speaking French around you.

You mustled up some courage, remembered the few French phrases you know, went up to a charming female blonde.

"Excusez-moi, mademoiselle, vous parlez anglais? Je suis perdu. Est-ce que vous pouvez aide-moi?" You asked.

"Mais, bien sur. Yes, I do speak English."

"Excellent!" you exclaim.  You tell her everything you know so far and she suggests you follow her.

She walks towards a local train into the city.  Do you?
