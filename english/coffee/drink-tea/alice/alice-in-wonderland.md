But your surroundings are not growing larger, you are shrinking! In 10 more seconds, 
you are about the height of 2 regular sized marshmallows stacked one on the other.

"Curiouser and curiouser", you say out loud to no one in particular and then wonder 
if talking to yourself makes you crazy. You quickly look around to see if anyone 
noticed, but there is only the marshmallow hand, and it does not have an ear.

Then it hits you that you are too small to escape the marshmallow prison. You cannot 
lift your crappy wand. Your tiny mouth could not possibly gnaw through the walls. 
Oh dear oh dear. And inexplicably you attempt to check your pocket watch.

Then...what's that? It's a chocolate mini marshmallow on the floor. It nearly escaped 
your notice. You think, "what the hell?" and eat it. Now your surroundings are shrinking
! No! You are growing!

"O frabjious day, caloo callay!", you whoop, but your jubilation is premature for 
within seconds, you pass your original size and keep growing until you fill the entire 
room and have to curl yourself into a yoga pretzel. 

"Wait", you say out loud to yourself, "Marshmallows are soft. I could just stand 
up!" And with that, you do. The roof gives way with a floomp sound, and you're standing 
in the dazzling light of a beautiful day, wearing what looks like a marshmallow skirt.

"This is impossible." you say, once again, outloud to yourself.

"That's nothing" purrs a long bulbous green thing lying nearby on the ground. "Why
, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."
