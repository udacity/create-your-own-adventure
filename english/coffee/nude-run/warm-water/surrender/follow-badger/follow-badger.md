Bereft, you look all around yourself for signs of the badger. 
All that you see is the armchair, which looks as alone as you 
feel. You approach it, hoping for a sign of what to do. A 
hitch in the herringbone on one arm catches your eye, and 
you recognize one of the badger's hairs lodged in the wool 
upholstery.

You take the grey hair and sit, uncomfortably sticky, on the 
armchair, holding the badger hair aloft like an unlit torch. 
What was it that the badger said? "The more I think about it, 
the more certain I become that we are all made of bees."

You close your eyes again and see the badger's deep eyes. You 
reach inward to connect with the state of bee-ing that you 
share with the badger - with all badgers. You feel the honey 
on your skin buzz and lift, your inner bees carrying you 
gently into the warm and salty onshore breeze. Your eyes 
tightly closed, you cannot tell whether you are being borne 
swiftly or not at all into the breeze. Suddenly you feel your 
bare feet touch warm stone, and you are standing. You open 
your eyes to the welcome sight of your teacher, the badger, 
nattily dressed as before.

"I sense that you are a coffee drinker," he says. Would you 
care for a cup?
