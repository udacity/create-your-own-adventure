You just had another cup of coffee, 
now what do you do?
But after that, things can get choppy.
Coffee, to some, is the nectar of life.
One or two cups is never enough.
They turn to espresso: "The hard stuff!"
Too much, however, will surely cause strife.
Is coffee all that matters anymore?
I must figure out what will satisfy my overwhelming desires!
You are quite hungry aren't you ?
Coffee is the hope for tired, a hug for the chilled, and a smile for a long lost friend.
