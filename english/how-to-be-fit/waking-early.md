Waking up early is not really an issue unless you make it an issue.

The easiest way to get up on your desired time is to instruct your brain while sleeping one night prior.

For example If you wish to wake up at 6:00 AM say to your sub conscious brain wake me up at sharp 6 :00 AM.

Well Bingo! with out an alarm clock your eyes will be open at 6!

Now how to get out of bed??
