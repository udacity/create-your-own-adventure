You are really confused, you faint again, wake up and get a migraine.

In front of you, on the ground, you see what appears to be a child's toy train.
You could [pick it up](../train-ride/train-ride.md)

Or you could [ponder your existence](../thesituation/situation.md)

Or... what's that on my neck? [A spider?](../TheSpider/Spiderman.md)

But you do feel a little hungry ... maybe it's [time for a snack](../thunder-carrots/thunder-carrots.md) and some [tea](../tea/tea.md)

Or perhaps a little [yoga?](../yoga/yoga.md)
