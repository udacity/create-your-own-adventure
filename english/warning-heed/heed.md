"So what is the problem?" you ask the man with the crazy hair.

The old man replies, "Within this area there exists a bridge to multiple
universes."
As you start to walk away, he continues, "Don't walk away now, I haven't
finished."
"The fabric that keeps these mutliverses from breaking into our reality is 
thin here. You will find strange happenings going on. Some of these incursions
will be harmless, others can be deadly.", the old man continues.
"How different are these multiverses?", you ask.
"Well," he continues, "the basic eveidence of the incursion is a difference 
in your reality. For instance, you may see a building where the was none 
before, people you thought were dead are now alive or vice versa, as well 
seeing animals that should be extinct or rare. Major incursions will be 
evidenced by major changes in the fabric of your reality, such as historical 
events playing out differntly than you remember. These changes may last 
briefly, but there is always the danger that they can become youri permanent 
reality."
"So how do we stop these excursions?", you ask the old man.
"Well, it's not as easy as falling off a log, but there is a way. 
First, we need to get some kalimoxto, then we need to ...."
Suddenly at that moment something which resembles a cross between a shark, 
man and elephant comes out of nowhere, grabs the old man with the crazy hair
in what can only be described as a trunk and shoved into the razor sharp teeth 
lining the jaws of the sharmanphant.

You stand there drenched in the blodd of the old man with the crazy hair as the 
sharmanphant slowly turns towards you, blood dripping from its teeth...
