His eyes widen at the marshmallow hands.
They had promptly sprouted from the walls upon his arrival and were now reaching for him.
He whips out a gizmo which emits a high-pitched sound, aiming it at various marshmallow hands.
Then he turns to you.

Doctor: "Right then, follow me."

You: "Oh really? Follow you, just like that, eh?  
  Well fa la la you seem to be mighty popular with these marshmallows.  
  Who are you anyway?"

Doctor: "I'm the Doctor. 
  I'm a Time Lord. 
  I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the Constellation of Kasterborous. 
  I'm 903 years old 
  and I'm the man who is gonna save your lives and all 6 billion people on the planet below. 
  You got a problem with that?"

An older man, armed with attack eyebrows, enters the room as you're about to follow the man calling
himself the Doctor.  "Don't follow him, I didn't know then what I know now.  Hello Doctor," he says
to the first man.  "Oh, hello Doctor," replies the first Doctor.
