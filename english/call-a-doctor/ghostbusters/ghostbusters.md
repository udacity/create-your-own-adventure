The door opens a crack and a doctor sticks his head in.

"What now?" he asks.

"The Stay-Puft Marshmallow, man," you tell the doctor.

"What about him?"

"Well, what happens? Greg went nuts last night before we got to finish the movie!"

"Movie hour is on Tuesday nights, you know that," the doctor explains.

"Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!!!"

The doctor's hands appear with a folder thick with documents. He scribbles on one. 
Then he looks up at you. You can sense his disappointment. "You can finish the movie 
next week. Until then ... Dr. Sakamoto will be here later on for another round of shock treatments."
