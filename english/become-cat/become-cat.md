The world appears to have grown larger.

Meow! 

...

Meow?

Another cat walks up to you.

"Hello there." What? It speaks! What's going on?
"You seem confused; you have begun your journey as a cat," it says.
"My name is Grayson."

You look down and realize you have become a housecat, and begin to get distracted by your tail.
Wait... No, you snap back to realization. What's going on! 

All of a sudden you have cravings for tuna and laying across a computer keyboard.

Grayson remarks, "You're more than welcome to give your legs a test."

Where do you go from here?
