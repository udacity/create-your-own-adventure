You decide that the quickest way down to just jump. 

The wind rushes through your face and you hit terminal velocity, you're quickly reminded of some important 
and very relevant words of wisdom from your friends Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect. 
"Flying is easy, all you have to do is throw yourself at the ground and miss."

Fortunately, you have terrible aim and you glide to safety toward the ground. 


And then live a happy life with your significant other.
