You race for the twisting stair case. The officer is catching up,
but you race up the stairs. As you round your way up the stairs you
hear the officer pounding up behind you. You glance back and see
him only a few steps away!

You notice an open gate and pathway to your left.

Run through the [gate](../gate/gate.md).
