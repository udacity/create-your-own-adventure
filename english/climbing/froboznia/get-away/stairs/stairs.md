You race for the twisting stair case. The officer is catching up,
but you race up the stairs. As you round your way up the stairs you
hear the officer pounding up behind you. You glance back and see
him only a few steps away!

Ahead of you is an open gate and coming up to your right is a large box.

Go through the [gate](gate/gate.md).
