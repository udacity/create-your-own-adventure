Upon closer inspection, one of the marshmallows is making bird sounds.

A Marshmallow Peep!

The twittering sounds like a muffled, frantic, "Help me, help me!" 

You chuckle to yourself thinking, "Wizards always try to play god". 

You use the fork to free the bird from its gooey prison. It is very small

but very strong. You tie the rope to its feet and:

Are lifted [to freedom](../marshmallow.md) Or so you hope...

Enjoy the [ride](../enjoy-DreamRide/ride.md)

Pinch [yourself.](../is-this-a-dream/is-this-a-dream.md)
