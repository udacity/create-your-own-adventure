You point your blowtorch arms downward, and turn up the heat.

You fly into the sky! Or at least, that's what you *thought* would happen. 
Instead, the blowtorches just get longer, and more concentrated. Like a fiery "LightSaber".

In a suprised motion, you do a quick circle trying to figure out what's going on. And when you turn, so do your arms.
You make a hole in the floor and fall through, landing on some sort of a wide sloping slide. -Not unlike the slide levels from Super Mario 64-

You deactivate your arms, so you don't end up losing a leg. Looking behind you, you see the chocolate begin pouring into the room from the hold you made in the floor.

Now what?
