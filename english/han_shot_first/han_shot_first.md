This marshmallow tastes great!  The white fluffiness of the marshmallow
brings you back to an early childhood memory of eating marshmallows and 
watching Star Wars.  Suddenly you remember to finish your grad school thesis on why
Han shot first in the cantina.  As you furiously type away at your keyboard on your laptop,
you hear a noise behind you and you:

Turn to hear the [noise] (lightsaber/lightsaber.md)

or 

Decide to take a break and play your favorite [game] (zork/zork.md)
