You enjoy the warm cup of cocoa and you have a conversation with the big bird that approached. It is actually
Big Bird from Sesame Street. You ask him what he is doing in the forest and ask him if he would like
a cup of "cocoa". He starts to correct you and says it is pronounced "co-co-aaaaaaaaa" and not "co-co".
This pointless debate ensues for a few minutes until he concedes that it is indeed cocoa after you google
the correct pronunciation. Then you ask him again what he is doing in the forest.

He says:

"I am searching for delicious mushrooms. Do you have any?"

You realize that this day has gotten out of hand.

Big bird is scary, the cocoa not longer tastes good, you want to go home.

Luckily for you, GOB appears behind you and sticks a pill into your mouth.

The last thing you hear before everything goes black

"Have a forget-me-now Michael"
