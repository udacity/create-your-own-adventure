we feel so much busier these days because we’ve got so much more to do ?

Time has literally become more valuable: any given hour is worth more.

We live in an “infinite world” There are always more incoming emails, more meetings, more things to read, more ideas to follow up.

we’re each finite human beings, with finite energy and abilities, attempting to get through an infinite amount. 

your feelings of busyness leave you even busier than before.
