So I took Udacity "Git and Github" course. It is is my technical MOOC which I
completed. Prior to that I completed "Learning How to Learn" in coursera.

I learned a lot from this course about git and github by taking this course.
Some of the things learned are:
  - cloning a repo
  - adding files, commiting etc
  - concepts about working dir, staging area
  - branches and merging
  - remote repos
  - forking repos
  - collaboarting with others - pull requests etc.

I recommend anyone who is interested in the subject to take this course.
