Zen for 30 minutes
Run for 30 minutes

Take a shower for 10 minutes
Now it is 6:40

		[Love your job]
			=> enjoy and fun. Make something you enjoy
		[Hate your job, work for money only, but good money]
			=> just do what boss say or what you want to do to get more money
		[Hate your job, work for money only but poor money]
			=> dead end, your life is suck. Your whole day is boring. Always don't know what should I do
