Hermione, Harry, and Ron bundle up and start for Hogsmeade.
On their way they see some suspicious debris along the path,
but ignore it all because they're craving for Butterbeer is very real.
As they enter Hogsmeade the lights from The Three Broomsticks beckon, so they quicken their pace.
Once they've chosen a cozy spot near the fire, Madam Rosmerta brings them a bottle of Butterbeer each, 
and they spend their afternoon in bliss.

"You know", Harry says after some time, "I bet I could totally bring dobby back if I learned elven magic"
Ron's eyes widen comically.
