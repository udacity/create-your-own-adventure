Do you know what social media platforms like Facebook(https://facebook.com),
Instagram(https://instagram.com) and Snapchat(https://snapchat.com) are for?

The sole purpose they serve is falsely feeding our egos by making us feel
that people actually care about our lives, about what we do, where we go, who
we hang out with, and so on. They help us to beg (yes, "BEG") others of
our kin to look at us. 

"LOOK AT ME," we scream through them.
"Look at me, I exist, I am there, I am NOT a nobody."

But the truth, sweetheart, is that you ARE a nobody, you AREN'T doing anything
worthwhile in life, you ARE wasting your time, and nobody gives two biscuits
about what Snapchat filter you have used in your so-and-so story.

So get off your biscuit and do something that'd actually make a difference.
That would make the world look at you not because you keep on throwing posts
with popular hashtags at it, not becuase you force yourself on it,
basically, not because YOU think that you are so darn special and cool and
awesome, but because the world thinks that you are special and cool and awesome
and brilliant and so it WANTS to look at you.

There's a reason why people like Elon Musk aren't active on Instagram, Snapchat
and what-not and why people like Justin Bieber are.

The choice is yours:

1. Do what every idiot does(https://www.google.co.in/search?q=puppy+filter&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj10LKipovSAhVMqY8KHVQ4CCMQ_AUICCgB&biw=1366&bih=610)

OR

2. Do something big, something different, something REAL(http://more-sky.com/data/out/12/IMG_513957.png)
