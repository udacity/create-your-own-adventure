[Time for some teachings on life and success](swami-vivekananda/swami-vivekananda.md)

One morning, you wake up in a strange room with marshmallows for walls.

Thinking back, there are no memories to suggest that this should have been

anything but an ordinary morning. You didn't go out last night, you don't

usually take intoxicants, what's happening...?

But it's probably not worth dwelling on that right now, you could be in danger.

Grave danger.

These marshmallows are numerous and they look so delicious.

You reach out to grab a handful of the marshmallow wall, but you can't seem to take the handful away from the wall.

You also seem to be wearing an uncomfortable and restrictive jacket made of leather...

You begin to breakout of the jacket and find a lighter, a fork, and rope.

You are not sure who placed these objects near you or why.

But you have a growing sense that these mundane objects are vital to your survival.

You decide to try to light a fire to melt some of the marshmallows so you look for some kindling.

You have the suspicion that you are being closely watched.

You see a polar bear searching for food.

"Well- OK" you admit to yourself, "Perhaps I do indulge in the occAsional intoxicant!"

You hear a small bird sound in the distance.

But it sounds like it might be coming out of speakers.

When you look away, a marshmallow hand attempts to grab the lighter.

But you are too quick for the marshmallow!

The realization suddenly dawns upon you the marshmallow is self aware!

If you don't do something quickly, this marshmallow belly will digest you!

Marshmallows are going to rule the world!

Long live marshmallows!

Hold the image of the marshmallow and..

Sing softly the song of it's people as you...

BUT!!!! wait a minute... Do you hear that??

A soft echo of a torrent is fading from far...

I felt a sudden ease of mind.

"Ok", I said to myself, "I need to get out of here"

"But first I must remember the magic spell needed to open the enchanted door!"
