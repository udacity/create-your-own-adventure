[Time for some teachings on life and success](swami-vivekananda/swami-vivekananda.md)

One morning, you wake up in a strange room with marshmallows for walls.

*(Must be a Tuesday.)*

For a second, you decide whether or not to just [go back to sleep](go-back-to-sleep/go-back-to-sleep.md)

A sound from a Hitchcock movie fills the room, then quickly fades away.

Thinking back, there are no memories to suggest that this should have been
anything but an ordinary morning. You didn't go out last night, you don't
usually take intoxicants, what's happening...?

But it's probably not worth dwelling on that right now, you could be in danger.

Grave danger. Oh No!

*(Is there another kind?)*

I actually used to know a guy named Dave Granger. We sure had some good times! Anyway, the possibility of danger lurks.

The type of extreme mortal danger that so often accompanies confectionary inspired interior design.
Quickly surveying your immediate surrounds, you notice a garishly dressed, 
vacant-eyed young man lounging on a nearby sofa.

[Pinch yourself to see if this is a dream.](./is-this-a-dream/is-this-a-dream.md)

You recall what a man said to you once: "Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover
where your strength and your power are needed. Always hold in your heart the
pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El; they wish to
be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their
capacity for good, I have sent them you... my only son."

[Remember that you are superman.](./remember-you-are-superman/remember-you-are-superman.md)

[Interrogate the man for clues.](./movie-ripoffs/zoolander/zoolander.md)  

These marshmallows are numerous and they look so delicious.
... despite the feeling they're somehow judging you for only wearing one sock.

You reach out to grab a handful of the marshmallow wall, but you can't seem to take the handful away from the wall.

You also seem to be wearing an uncomfortable and restrictive jacket made of leather...

[You decide to bite the marshmallow wall.](./bite-the-marshmallow/tasty-marshmallow.md)

You are feeling very anxious at this point.

This is because you do not like leather for ethical reasons.

You begin to break out of the jacket and find a lighter, a fork, and rope.

You also find a new packet of double chocolate caramel Tim Tams inside a pink sock.

Do you want to [try to fill the remaining space in the sock with marshmallows](./fill-sock/fill-sock.md)?

You are not sure who placed these objects near you or why.

But you have a growing sense that these mundane objects are vital to your survival.

You decide to try to light a fire to melt some of the marshmallows so you look for some kindling.

[You have the suspicion that you are being closely watched.](./watched/watched.md)

[Of course, it's that man on the sofa; go talk to him again.](./movie-ripoffs/zoolander/zoolander.md)

[Wait, I'm in front of a mirror... Am I? Let's see...](./mirror/enter-mirror.md)

You see a polar bear searching for food.

"Well- OK," you admit to yourself, "perhaps I do indulge in the occasional intoxicant!"

You hear a small bird sound in the distance.

But it sounds like it might be coming out of speakers.

Something lightly brushes the back of your neck, sending a chill down your spine! 

Startled, you immediately whirl around to see who (or what) touched you...but there's no one behind you.

When you look away, a marshmallow hand attempts to grab the lighter.

But you are too quick for the marshmallow!

The realization suddenly dawns upon you the marshmallow is self aware!

If you don't do something quickly, this marshmallow belly will digest you!

Marshmallows are going to rule the world!

Long live marshmallows!

Hold the image of the marshmallow and...

Sing softly the song of it's people as you...

BUT!!!! wait a minute... Do you hear that??

A soft echo of a torrent is fading from far...

I felt a sudden ease of mind.

"Ok", I said to myself, "I need to get out of here"

"But first I must remember the magic spell needed to open the enchanted door!"

You pick up the fork and wrap it in rope to fashion a crappy wand.

Pointing it at the door, eyes closed, "Alohomora..."

Nothing seems to be happening.

Sheepishly you look down on the crappy wand in your hand.
 
You must be doing something wrong. You drink a beer and think about it, then Ah-ha!

You notice your pants are now glowing, so you must have been holding the wand upside down.

Suddenly, you become aware of the need to take a leak.
You can't hold it. You wonder, Are glowing pants waterproof?
