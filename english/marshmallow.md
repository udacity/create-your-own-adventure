One morning, you wake up in a strange room with marshmallows for walls.

Thinking back, there are no memories to suggest that this should have been

anything but an ordinary morning. You didn't go out last night, you don't

usually take intoxicants, what's happening...?

But it's probably not worth dwelling on that right now, you could be in danger.

These marshmallows are numerous and they look so delicious.

You also seem to be wearing an uncomfortable and restrictive jacket made of leather...

You begin to breakout of the jacket and find a lighter, a fork, and rope.

You have the suspicion that you are being closely watched.

When you look away, a marshmallow hand attempts to grab the lighter.

The realization suddenly dawns upon you the marshmallow is self aware!

Hold the image of the marshmallow and..
