One morning, you wake up in a strange room with marshmallows for walls.

These marshmallows are numerous and they look so delicious.

You also seem to be wearing an uncomfortable and restrictive jacket made of leather...

You begin to breakout of the jacket and find a lighter, a fork, and rope.

You have the suspicion that you are being closely watched.

When you look away, a marshmallow hand attempts to grab the lighter.

The realization suddenly dawns upon you the marshmallow is self aware!

Hold the image of the marshmallow and..
