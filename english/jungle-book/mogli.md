In the jungles of India, a group of villagers are sightseeing.

Later that night, Shere Khan the tiger, and his sidekick Tabaqui the hyena attack the villagers.

A young boy named Mowgli runs off in search of his parents, only to get lost.

He is eventually taken into a wolf pack by wolf parents, Akela and Raksha.

Mowgli makes friends with Baloo the bear, Bagheera the panther, Chil the vulture, and Hathi the elephant.

One day, Hathi takes Mowgli for a ride on his back in order to give him a tour of the jungle.

Mowgli learns that man poses a danger to the jungle and the animals after witnessing a burned down part of the jungle due to fire.

On a pack meeting, Mowgli and his wolf sister, Little Raksha are chosen to become hunters for the pack, much to the dismay of the wolf bullies.

Shere Khan confronts the wolf pack and demands them to hand over Mowgli.

Raksha and Akela refuse, exhorting that Mowgli is their son.

Bagheera and Baloo arrive and swear to protect Mowgli from Shere Khan.

Shere Khan then assures Mowgli that one day, he will get his revenge, when the pack, Bagheera, or Baloo won't be able to protect him.
