Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Our natural tendency is to love krishna but it is covered by maya.
Chanting of the mantra "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare" will remove that covering.
And we will go back home back to godhead.
