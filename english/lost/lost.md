lost hmm .. follow me: 

* If you do not know what to then just google it [google](https://www.google.com/) 
* If you did not find an answer ask it on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)
* If you found too many answers, just ask someone close too you about it.  it good to have human interactions sometimes.
* If still can not make up your mind, then just until 3 and pick the first thing comes to your mind. Or just get over it and forget about the whole thing. this called denial.
* If you are only looking to go back to the main page then click [here](../marshmallow.md)
