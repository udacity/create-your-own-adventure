You run back and forth slamming into one wall and then the one opposite it.
As you do this, the walls begin to undulate. After a few minutes the undulations
become so great that you can no longer run back and forth. Suddenly the walls
close tighly around you and push you upwards toward a tunnel where there is
an increasing intensity of light. You are thrown from the mouth of the tunnel
and land on a pile of gingerbread, shaken, but unharmed.

You find yourself in a vast world of high-added-sugar-content foods.
