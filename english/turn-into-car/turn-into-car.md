It's a cool Sunday morning, and you're jogging alongside the road with your beats headphones on.
Your favorite track [No Glory by Skan & Krale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc-XxqEyolU) is playing and you're
speeding up with the beat.
BAM! You hear a loud noise out of nowhere and snap out of your music world. You don't see anything happening on
your front so you look around.
You see that a car has run into an old woman. The onlookers rush to help the woman. The car driver is yet to step out
of his car to see what's happened.
You suspect he's going to make a run for it. You wait to see what happens. It feels like an hour but only seconds
have passed. The car reverses a bit and does a wheelspin. Off goes the car! You were right! You kick your heels off
the ground and chase after the car like a mad cheetah that wants to prove it's the fastest animal. You think to
yourself, "It would've been amazing if I was the Flash right now. I could've caught the guy in a nanosecond". You're
running with all your might but the car is receding away from you. You feel frustrated. Angry. Betrayed. Ashamed of
the human race. You close your eyes and wish this was a dream. There's a silence and darkness that envelopes your
being. You open your eyes, and you're going really fast. But you feel weird. You don't understand what it is. You 
feel shorter, and it's as if you expanded somehow. You look down and to your sides and see no hands or legs. All 
you see is a damaged car bumper. You're flabbergasted. You're confused. You hear your [favorite track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc-XxqEyolU) again.
You close your eyes and wonder if it's really a dream. You open your eyes. You see a different world. A person is
on the wheel and driving frantically, your favorite track is playing on the radio, and suddenly it sets in. He's the
guy that hit the old woman. He's the one running away. And you...  
.  
.  
.  
...ARE THE CAR.
