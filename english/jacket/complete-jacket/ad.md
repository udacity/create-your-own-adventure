You craft the greatest marshmallow jacket the world has ever seen. You're so 
excited to show your family and friends this life changing achivement. 
You step outside and a little boy runs up to you and asks "Michelin Man, can I 
have your autograph?"

You spend the rest of your life selling tires.
Thinking back on the history of tires let me tell you an intersting story.
There was a cycle race the next day as was the tradition.
Little John never won a race but came back all bruised and tired after every race.
His father Dunlop couldn't tolerate this. But that was how the cycles were in those days.
They had wooden wheels which caused a lot of trouble for the children.
So one evening, a day before the race, Dunlop took the garden hose and 
filled it with air and fixed it around the tire of his son's cycle. 
The next day not only did John win the race but did it in half the time
of the others and the best part was he wasn't bruised. The father then 
started a company and today we know it as Dunlop Tyres.
