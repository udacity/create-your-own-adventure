When you wake up, you're still in the strange room with marshmallows for walls.
The walls smell really good, but are they tasty?

It would be nice to find out, but not all by themselves.
You need something to go with them.
Maybe some chocolate.

You wish there were some chocolate furniture too.

And suddenly your wish come true, the chocolate furniture appears,
and you start thinking is it really possible,
whatever i think will come true.

You think if you should wish there was a way to melt these chocolates
