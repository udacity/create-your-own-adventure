You think to yourself, "What's the worst that can happen?"

You eye the biggest, baddest soldier in the room, 
a gorilla looming over you.

You tear the spear from a nearby soldier's hands 
and hurl it directly at the massive gorilla.

He easily catches the spear with his shield, 
but in doing so, creates a gap in the shield. 

Do you...
