You pick the most approachable of the green s'more-eaters and ask them if you can share a s'more.

They hand you a long green roasting rod, green chocolate, and green graham crackers. You dig some marshmallow out of
the nearest wall onto the tip of the rod and warm it over the fire for a moment.

The result looks a little strange, but it is just as delicious as you could have imagined. Afterward, all you can
think about is taking a big nap.
