You pick the most approachable of the green s'more-eaters and ask them if you can share a s'more.

They hand you a long green roasting rod, green chocolate, and green graham crackers. You dig some marshmallow out of the nearest wall onto the tip of the rod and warm it over the fire for a moment.

The result looked a little strange, but it was just as delicious as you could imagine. Afterward, all you can think about is taking a big nap.
