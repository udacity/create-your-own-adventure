You donn't know why, but you just can't help but got back to sleep again!
As you drift into unconsciousness, you can't help but wonder why it is that you don't want to do anything but sleep.
Even in your unconsciousness you are sensing that you are moving your legs.
And it's at that moment that you hear the voice chanting "Sleep...sleep" in your head.
Before you can even process what's going on, you've fallen into a deep sleep.
