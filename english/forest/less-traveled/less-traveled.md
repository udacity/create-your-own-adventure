You want adventure and have decided to take the road less traveled.  With thoughts of gold and conquests running through
your mind, you begin to imagine yourself 'Ruler of the World'.  As you continue down your path, something bumps you on
your shoulder. You stop and look around, but see nothing and continue on.  A few steps later, you feel something hit your
shoulder again.  You stop to look around and, again, see nothing.  You wonder to yourself, "Am I imagining things?".

You decide to rest. You sit on the forest floor and open your sack.  "Thank goodness I brought my bottle of water" you
think to yourself.  As you take the first few sips, a cloud of purple smoke appears in front of you and large booming
voice says, "Who are you? Why have you entered my Forest?". The combination of the smoke and mysterious voice have scared
you to your core.
