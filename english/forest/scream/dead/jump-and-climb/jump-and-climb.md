As soon as you jump up to climb the nearby tree, the tiger's right
front paw, rips apart your spine... 

Pure white agony courses through you but before you could scream,
tiger's jaws crush your head and with it, your life meets its tragic
end..

The tiger enjoys the feast before going back to the forest to prey on
some another unfortunate soul.
