You decide to call out for help.

"HEEEEEEEEELP!" you scream.

Nothing.

"HEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!!! Is there anybody that can hear meee?"

Still nothing. You wait for a little bit. There's rustling in the bushes!
Could it be someone that will come to my aid and rescue me?

Nope. Out of the bushes jumps a tiger and it's a pretty big one too. He looks
hungry.

What will you do?
