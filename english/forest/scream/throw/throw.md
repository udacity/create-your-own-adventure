You hurl anything in your grasp towards the tiger's head. Twigs, your shoes,
moss. If only he left you alone!

This seems to piss off the tiger, and he slowly comes closer.

You cower in fear, and furiously try to crawl backwards.

The tiger lunges at you, mouth open, paws ready to strike. You close your eyes
and brace for the worst. Suddenly, you feel the ground pounding, swiftly
followed by a loud screeching scream, as if from a giant bird. The next thing
you feel is a thud, followed by a deafening roar from the tiger. You open your
eyes and see a velociraptor fighting with the tiger. It looks like the hunter
has become the hunted.

After the velocirapter is done with the tiger, it turned it feathery head
towards you, and ate you. This is unfortunate. If only you had thought to flee.
