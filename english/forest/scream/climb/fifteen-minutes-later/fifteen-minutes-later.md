You open your eyes and shift slightly. You realize you are still in the tree. With a jerk, you grab onto a nearby branch to maintain your balance. Looking towards the ground you see the tiger sprawled across the forest floor. 

Is it sleeping? you wonder to yourself. 

Then with horror you remember your right leg was ripped off at the shin. The tourniquet kept you alive, but the unbearable pain returns. 

"I'm gonna die here!" you openly sob to the surrounding trees.

"No, we're going to make it through this."

You cut your sobbing short, startled by a voice coming from below.

You cast your eyes down again. Standing near the tiger holding a pistol is a woman. 

"Marissa! You survived!" you cry with astonishment rising in your voice.

"Yes--we survived! Do you think you can make it down?" Marissa calls up to you.
