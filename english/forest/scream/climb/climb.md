You decide to climb the nearest tree where your parachute is hanging. Perhaps
you can use your large parachute to scare the tiger away. Habitat loss has made
the Malayan tiger extremely hungry and ferocious towards humans.

From your knees you stand up on your left leg without ever taking your eyes off
the tiger. The tiger crouches, ears forward, pupils dilated, mouth focused.

You try to nimbly stand upon your right leg. You can still feel the sharp pain
from your right shin, but your spiking adrenaline has made you numb to
everything but the fight or flight of the moment. The tiger wiggles, testing its
hind legs for stability.

You rush up. "SNAP" You hear your fibula break before you feel the renewed
searing pain radiate upwards. You fall to the ground in a lump. The tiger
pounces.

It grabs your right shin securly in hits jaws. The broken bone allows
the tiger to rip the shin, ankle, and foot cleanly away.

You crawl to the nearest tree only a few meters away. With all of your energy
you grab its low, thick branches and climb. From a safe perch you notice that
your parachute is still 15 meters above you. You fasten a tourniquet and pass
out.

The tiger finishes his quick feast and gazes upward, mouth agape, panting.
