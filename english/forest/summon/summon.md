You gather sticks and create a "C" shape on the forest floor. 

You begin chanting Git commands.

"...checkout, log, clone, diff, push, forest, forest, fores..."

Suddenly a blinding flash and wave of energy shoots you back several feet.

As the smoke settles a silhouette forms in the darkness and begins to speak...

"OH NO, NOT THE FOREST!. NOT AGAIN!"

The silhouette grabs the nearest branch and rushes towards you screaming,"DELETE! DELETE! DELETE!"
