You spot a tree not very far away that has some sturdy-looking branches. Although it is difficult with your injured leg,
you limp over and slowly make your way up as far as you can.

Now sitting on a thick branch with a crevice that allows you to prop yourself up securely against the trunk, you settle
in to figure out what to do next.

Suddenly, you hear a sound below. Looking down, you realize that a bear has wandered over to where you previously were.
It's a good thing you didn't build a shelter down there!
