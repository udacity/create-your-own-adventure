You ignore the ringing phone and empty out all the pockets of your cargo pants
into a pile. Your wallet is gone, having fallen in the woods like your phone.

 Your pile of possessions includes some food, duct tape, a pocket knife, and a
 small box wrapped up like a present. It is the present your best friend handed
 you at the airport as they dropped you off because tomorrow is your birthday.

There's a deep growling sound coming from the woods in the direction of your
phone. Is that a bear growl? Wow, good thing you didn't go search for it.
