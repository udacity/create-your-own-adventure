You gather some nearby twigs and branches. Luckily, the twigs and branches are
dry enough to light. Too bad you don't have a lighter or the skills to make
fire.

All this gathering of firewood materials has attracted the attention of a big
mean bear. He decides to eat you. Unfortunately, since your leg is broken, you
can't get away. You end up a bear's snack.



Or do you? You experience a sharp pain in your head and slowly open your eyes.
It is very hot and you're sweating a lot. You haven't eaten for days. It was
a bad dream, but you're still stuck on that island.

You see a huge cruise ship in the distance, way out in the ocean.
