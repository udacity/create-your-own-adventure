You gather some nearby twigs and branches. Luckily, the twigs and branches are
dry enough to light. Too bad you don't have a lighter or the skills to make
fire.

All this gathering of firewood materials has attracted the attention of a big
mean bear. He decides to eat you. Unfortunately, since your leg is broken, you
can't get away. You end up a bear's snack.



Or do you? You experience a sharp pain in your head and slowly open your eyes.
It is very hot and you're sweating a lot. You haven't eaten for days. It was
a bad dream, but you're still stuck on that island.

You see a huge cruise ship in the distance, way out in the ocean.

Blood clouds your vision and the cruise ship starts to flicker on and off.
Like someone turning the channel in your brain. A loud ringing in your ears with
a sharp pain in your leg and face welcome you back to the forest.

After the bear becomes bored of your limp body he begins to rummage through your
backpack. After chomping down the sweet candy bars in the front pocket he
shambles of into the forest.

So this is where you decided to kick ass. That bear is food and he ate all of
yours. However your fire is still lite and your wounds are aching. Also, it may
just be the brain damage, but you think you hear a stream off in the darkest
part of the woods. What should you do?
