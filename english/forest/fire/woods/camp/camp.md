You return to the camp to find the bear still there, now accompanied by a tiger.
You look further and see a kangaroo, and a piglet. You've seen this before, but you can't quite remember where.
A donkey clumsily appears and asks you your name. You reply in a confused voice: "Christopher...."
"Christopher Robin?"...

Then donkey looks puzzled. "You don't look like the Christopher Robin I know," he says. "I hope you aren't lying to me. It is so discouraging when people lie to me."

The bear approaches you and sticks out a paw. "I'm Pooh!" he says. "I'm awfully sorry for licking your face earlier. I thought there might be some honey on it."
