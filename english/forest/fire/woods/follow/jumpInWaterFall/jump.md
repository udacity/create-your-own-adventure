You fall and keep falling until you hit the water hard. You feel pain as you have never experienced before.
You struggle for breath but are still underwater. You struggle to reach break the surface and when you
finally do your lungs burn with air, yet it feels so good.
You feel pain and burn and stigs of bees yet you feel ecstatic for being alive.
You are alive and nothing else matters for now, except for reaching the shore and celebrating your life 
little longer.
