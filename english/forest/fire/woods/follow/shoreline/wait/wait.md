You wait, and the ominous creature appears. A giant 8-headed dragon appears.
Over 30 feet tall, and each head spewing fire from their nostrils, the winged monster growls at you.
While you stand there trembling with fear, the dragon approaches slowly.

Suddenly a thought comes to your mind.
Maybe the powers given to you by the magical stream can make you invisible long enough to think of an escape plan.
But knowing how last time you used your powers almost ended in death, you cannot decide what to do.

The thumps of the dragon's footsteps grow louder and louder, shaking the earth beneath your feet.
You must make a quick decision to survive !!!
