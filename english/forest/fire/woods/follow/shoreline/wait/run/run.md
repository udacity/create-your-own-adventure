You run blindly into the woods.
You keep running and running, never looking back.
As fate would have it, you trip over a boulder and fall on the ground.
Even though your whole body is in extreme pain, you hopelessly try to crawl to safety.

Suddenly you hear deafening noises coming from the sky.
Terror grips your body as you realise the source of the dreaded sound.
Praying God to prove you wrong, you look up.

The dragon's fire breath was the last thing you saw before it burned you to death.........
