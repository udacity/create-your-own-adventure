As you stand your ground and try to use your powers, the dragon gets closer and closer.
Scared for life, you close your eyes and try to focus with every bit of strength left in you.
And voila, you become invisible.
You open your eyes feeling hopeful than before, but you are too late.
The dragon stands before you.

Bewildered by your vanishing, the dragon starts spitting fire all over the place.
As you see the world around you burn, you realise there's no escaping the inevitable.

You close your eyes one last time as the fire surrounds your body burning you alive.
Teary eyed, you wish you had made yourself fire proof as well !!!
