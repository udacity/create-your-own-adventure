You swim over to the boat and a couple of the people on the boat lean over to help you onto the boat.

After a quick greeting you are handed a towel to dry off with.

"Get back to the oars!" a gruff voice bellowed from the back of the boat. Violent streaks of pain
shoot through your body even as you instinctively try to comply. "Stay still..." a comforting
soft voice puts you back. A moment passes as the boat rocks gently. You become aware of a benign
presence around you. You try to open your eyes and sit up as gentle palms help you up.
You open your eyes to see a woman holding a cup up to you. You take in the aroma as your eyes
close back involuntarily. Mint tea. You tae a sip through erratic shrieks of pains along your mouth
muscles. But instantly feel good upon tasting the hot tea. You open your eyes again to see the kind
woman again with a look of concern on her gentle face. You try to open your mouth to say that you're
okay. But you could  only manage a tenous smile to convey your gratitude. The woman seemed
relieved. Her face was now calm. She was young. Perhaps in her early thirties. But had an air of
maturity beyond her years.

"My name is Sarah. What is your name?". The gentle voice interrupt your thoughts as you try to
recollect your life in the [city]. (city/cape_suzette.md)
