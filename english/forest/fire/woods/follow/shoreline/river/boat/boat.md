You swim over to the boat and a couple of the people on the boat lean over to help you onto the boat.

After a quick greeting you are handed a towel to dry off with.

The boat has four people occupying it that you can see.

There is a tall blonde woman wearing a ballroom dress and a man wearing a pin striped suit.

There are two other men wearing coveralls, one holding a fishing pole and the other holding a net.

"Are you alright?" the man in the pin striped suit asks. "You look like you aren't from around here."
