You throw yourself back into the river and flow downstream.
In the distance, you see a boat. You start swimming to the possibility of safety.
The people in the boat see you. They start to paddle towards you and you feel hope rising up within you, giving your body new strength. Perhaps, in a few minutes you will be safe inside the boat, surrounded by friendly faces.
