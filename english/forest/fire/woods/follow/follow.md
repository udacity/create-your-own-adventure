As you start to follow the shawman, you notice the bear behind you, drinking from the magical stream.
The bear is now twice as big, and looks angry.
You turn to ask for help from the shawman, but he's vanished.
You slowly turn to the bear, and feel a hot breath on the back of your neck.

Conjuring your new powers, you attempt to create a beehive full of honey to attract the bear.
Unfortunately you only manage to create the bees, now you can see them starting to swarm.   A moment
later they are chasing you and the bear deeper in to the forest.

You keep running in the general direction in which you think the shaman went. In the end you reach 
waterfall.
