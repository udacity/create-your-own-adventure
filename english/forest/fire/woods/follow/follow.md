As you start to follow the shawman, you notice the bear behind you, drinking from the magical stream.
The bear is now twice as big, and looks angry.
You turn to ask for help from the shawman, but he's vanished.
You slowly turn to the bear, and feel a hot breath on the back of your neck.

Conjuring your new powers, you attempt to create a beehive full of honey to attract the bear.
Unfortunately you only manage to create the bees, now you can see them starting to swarm.   A moment
later they are chasing you and the bear deeper in to the forest.

You keep running in the general direction in which you think the shaman went. In the end you reach 
waterfall and you jump.

You fall and keep falling until you hit the water hard. You feel pain as you have never experienced before.
You struggle for breath but are still underwater. You struggle to reach break the surface and when you
finally do your lungs burn with air, yet it feels so good.
You feel pain and burn and stigs of bees yet you feel ecstatic for being alive.
You are alive and nothing else matters for now, except for reaching the shore and celebrating your life 
little longer.
