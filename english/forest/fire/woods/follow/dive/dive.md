You dive down towards the bottom of the river and see a sparkle wedged 
between the rocks. You quickly reach out to grab it as you realize 
your lungs are almost out of air. Once you've surfaced again, you
head towards the shoreline to examine the object. As you catch your
breath, you examine the shiny object and realize that it's a gigantic
diamond! You start to cheer until you realize you're still stuck in the 
woods and don't know how you're going to get out of here.
