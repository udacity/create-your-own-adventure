Bravely you drag your wounded body into the woods leaving a trail of blood
behind you. Soon you find a stream. The water is crystal clear and the moonlight
reflects cleanly from the surface, illuminating the woods around you. After a
few drinks and washing your wounds you beging to feel amazing. The stream has
completely healed you. It must be magic!

Turning around, to head back to camp, you find yourself face to face with an
ancient shawman. He tells you that after one has drank from the stream of dreams
they are welcome to join the tribe of ancient warlocks.

Maybe you decided to follow the shawman deeper into the forest?
