You push through the bushes into the clearing on
the other side. As you get closer to the sound,
you notice that a fierce wind is blowing all
around you.

You look to see that in the middle of the clearing
is a giant object made out of something black
and shiny. The top of the object is spinning so
fast, you can't really make out what it is,
until the noise subsidesand it looks like four
arms or antenna making a plus shape.

Suddenly, a part of the object slides away
and a strange being steps out. It looks
similar to you!
