You ally yourself with the squirrels
They show you the ways of nut-storage and skin-winged flight

Living with the squirrels becomes more and more natural,
eventually you forget all about your life as a human...
until one day while you are collecting nuts your hear
a strange sound up in the sky. It gets louder and louder
but the trees are too thick where you are to see what's
causing it.

Soon the sound gets so close that it must be just on the
other side of some tall thick bushes.
