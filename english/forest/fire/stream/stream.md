You manage to crawl to the stream. 

The water looks clear and cool, 

and you know that you will get an infection 

if you do not clean your wounds soon.

You look around, and do not see any bears in sight.

You also begin to notice your thirst creeping up on you,

as you have not drunken any water in the heat of the day.
