You grab a long sharp branch off the ground next to your fire. Bloodlust pulses
through your veins as you stalk the bear. You find him sitting next to a tree
stump digging honey out of a poor bees nest. Running at the bear, spear in hand,
you sink the sharp end into his back and the bear cries out in pain.

Victory achieved, you march triumphntly back to your camp.

But not so fast! The bees are fast approaching. Rather than get stung you jump
into a nearby lake until they fly away. 

You climb out of the water dripping wet. The bees have gone. The sweet honey 
beckons to you. You saunter forward, remembering your first sip of mead. You 
quickly scoop a jar of honey from the thrashed beehive, stash it in your 
waterskin, and scamper back to camp unscathed.
