You take some moss and grass to make up a soft bed under one of the trees. Soon you fall 
asleep and a strange dream about a fox and a coyote starts to evolve. There appears an 
orange colored fox standing observant upon a fallen tree. In the thicket you notice yellow,
piercing eyes looking diretly at the fox. The eyes belong to a coyete that hasn't eaten in
several days.
