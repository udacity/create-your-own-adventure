An overwhelming pain echoes through your head. You feel the taste of dirt in
your mouth. Your hands are moist and you can feel the impression of twigs and
moss in your cheeks. You're in the forest.

You try to regain your thoughts, still dazed by the pain.

"Where am I?" you think. "How did I get here?"

As you slowly try to get up, a sharp pain burts through your right leg as you
put pressure on it. You scream out in pain. You can hear it echo through the
forest, as you fall to your knees. From the corner of your eye, you see
something hanging high up from a tree about twenty feet away. It's a parachute.

Suddenly it all comes back to you. The plane, the fight, panic, the pilot
getting knocked out. There was only one option. You managed to grab a parachute
and jumped into the unknown. You're lucky to have made it alive. But now what?

Instinctively, you want to reach for your back pocket. You can't feel the
reassuring thin rectangular shape pressing into you. But that's probably
because the pain pulsing up your leg is hiding it. Then you remember what
Caroline said. You're in the forest. There is no internet here. You are offline.
Google can't help you right now. You are on your own.
