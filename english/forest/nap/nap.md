You hear the sound of water as it meets resistance.  

The air is crisp and clean.  You hear it again.  The water.  
As you gain consciousness, you realize you are gently moving. Up and down.

You open your eyes all you see are the dim light of a couple dozen stars.

You sit up and your eyes begin to adjust to the darkness.

Up and down.

Another splash.

You peer into the darkness.  Your eyes adjust.
