You chase the squirrel down the path through the forest.
On and on you go, the forrest getting darker,
the squirrel seeming to get bigger...
Around a corner, the squirrel has stopped, and is standing staring at you.
Looking up into the face of the, grumpy looking, squirrel all calculations on
the size a squirrel steaks have evaporated from your mind, you turn and run for your life..
