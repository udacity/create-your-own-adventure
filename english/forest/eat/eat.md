In a panic, you stuff your face full of all the airplane 
pretzels and peanuts they gave you and slurp the last drop of
the Coke. There were exactly 12 peanuts and 7 pretzels. You
wonder if you should have rationed them out over the course
of a week or so, one pretzel and two peanuts per day. But 
it is too late, and you're still hungry.

You see a squirrel on a tree branch and wonder how much meat
is on it...

"Mmmm... Squirrel" you mutter uncontrolably as your mouth
starts to foam at the thought of it.

Startled, the squirrel scurries off into the distance, but not
to be beaten you give chase. After a few hundred yards you lose
sight of him in the fading light. As your eyes start to adjust
to the light you see the squirrel staring back at you. And another
just beyond him.

"You're in luck" you think to yourself. But you sense that they
are not alone.

Then you notice another. All of a sudden you realise that they're
eveywhere. Hundreds of squirrels! You're surrounded. You've walked
straight into their trap.

The hunter has become the hunted...
