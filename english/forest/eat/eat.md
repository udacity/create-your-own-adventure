In a panic, you stuff your face full of all the airplane
pretzels and peanuts they gave you and slurp the last drop of
the Coke. There were exactly 12 peanuts and 7 pretzels. You
wonder if you should have rationed them out over the course
of a week or so, one pretzel and two peanuts per day. But
it is too late, and you're still hungry.

You see a squirrel on a tree branch and wonder how much meat
is on it...An idea struck you, you can follow the squirrel home
to check out his stash of rations. Or are his mates trainable
to find food for you?
