You walk toward the light that gets more blinding and comforting
the closer you get.  Suddenly, you realize your spirit has been
lifted into the stars to eternally look down upon the universe.

At least that's how you perceive your new hereafter reality. 

But the truth is the hindus and buddhists were right and your positive karma freed you from the earthly cycle of death and rebirth into a new slumbering body of the world.
