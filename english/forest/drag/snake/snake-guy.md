The snake bites have given you super powers and now you can harness the powers
of rattlesnakes. You feel more alive than ever. Now you can leave the forest for 
good. Uh - oh!! You look down and realize that you have no legs. Where are your arms??
For some reason you can't stop shaking your tail. Now your body is full of scales. You hear 
someone coming. You try to yell for help, but all you can do is make a hissing sound. The person
is yelling. You can tell they are scared. Here they come! Quick! What do you do?
