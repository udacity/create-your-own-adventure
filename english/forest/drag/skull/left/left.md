You take the left-hand path. The path gradually slopes downwards as you go, the floor is a bit sticky
which helps you descend. The air is getting hot and dusty like water that has been left out overnight.
It soon becomes unbearably hot in the tunnel. Just when you thought you couldn't take anymore and decide
to turn back you come upon a doorway. Through the doorway is a wide lake of lava! There is a large blue
crystal floating over the lake. When you turn away from the crystal you see that the doorway you came
through has vanished, replaced with the rough rocky wall of the chamber.
