As u pick up the skull a string detaches from it and suddenly everything turns black.

As u regain vision u see youself in an empty white place with two paths.

You realize that you are actually holding onto your iPhone and not a skull and there is a new text message from an unknown source telling you to 

[take the path to the left][which-path/left-path.md] if you want to return to your life as you know it

or [choose the path to the right][which-path/right-path.md] to enter a new world with unknown but exciting adventures.  You can never return to your old life.
