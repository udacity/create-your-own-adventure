As u pick up the skull a string detaches from it and suddenly everything turns black.

As u regain vision u see youself in an empty white place with two paths.

To your left is a forest trail covered in snow with a faraway sign reading
"Ma's Place".
The way to your right is a tube of whorling rainbow smoke. Your skin crawls at
the sound of faint giggling far in the distance.
