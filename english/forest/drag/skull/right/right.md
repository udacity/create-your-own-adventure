You take the right-hand path. The path gradually slopes upwards as you continue on, handholds in the walls help
you walk up the incline. As you go the air is getting colder and drier, your breath escapes in chilly clouds
as you exert yourself climbing. The walk keeps you warm but you're starting to shiver as you come upon a doorway.
Through the doorway is a frigid valley in the middle of a snowstorm! Snow whirls around you as you approach the
edge of the valley, and see a large red crystal at the very bottom. Snow hisses and melts as it touches the
surface of the crystal. You spin to find the doorway you just came through but it has vanished.
