You close your eyes and remain still as the bear licks you several more times.
Its breath smells horrible! It stops licking you. You hear it move around the
tent. You hear the sound of wrappers being torn. The bear is eating your food!
Many minutes seem to pass while you listen to it eating your food. Finally, you
hear it leave the tent. You continue to play dead for a while, and then you open
your eyes.
