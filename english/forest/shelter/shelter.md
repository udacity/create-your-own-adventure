You break down some branches and make a frame. You put your parachute over
the top of it, tying it down securely with palm leaves. Luckily you did it
because as you make yourself comfortable for the night the heaven's open.
There's a terrible storm brewing...

You see a flash of lightning a clap of thunder. Suddenly you are in the middle of a monsoon.
The wind blows away your parachute like a dry leaf and buckets of water rain down on you.
Shivering in the dark wetness you can't believe this is happening.
Suddenly - [you wake up!](../../wake-up)
