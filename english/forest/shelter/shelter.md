You break down some branches and make a frame. You put your parachute over
the top of it, tying it down securely with palm leaves. Luckily you did it 
because as you make yourself comfortable for the night the heaven's open. 
There's a terrible storm brewing... 

This will be the worst storm to hit this 

area in over a century.
But you do not despair

And then you deploy your tent and sleep.

Suddenly, you feel a warm, wet sensation on your face. You open your eyes and
see a bear licking you.
