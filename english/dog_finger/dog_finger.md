while True {
    One night, a couple who had been out for a few too many drinks came home to find
    their dog choking in the living room. The man panicked and fainted, but the woman decided to call
    her old friend, a vet, and arranged to drop the dog off at the vet clinic.
    
    After dropping off the dog, she decides to go home and get her husband into bed. It takes her a while
    to do this, and in the meantime, the phone rings. The vet screams hysterically that they need
    to get out of the house immediately. So without any clue as to what’s going on, the couple leave
    the house as quickly as possible.

    As they come down the stairs, several policemen run up to meet them. When the woman ask 
    what the problem is, a policeman gently tells her that the dog was choking on a man’s finger. A burglar
    must still be present in their home. Soon enough, the former owner
    of the finger is found unconscious in the bedroom.
