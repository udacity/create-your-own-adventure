Remove 25 marshmallows from the wall,
Create 5 sets of 5 marshmallows each for a total of 25 in all,
Stick 4 marshmallows together from each set together like a string,
Separate each set with another marshmallow half an inch in between,
For sure you will enjoy the look of each bead,
Marshmallow here I come I will eat you in peace.
