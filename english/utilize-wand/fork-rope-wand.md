Letting out a light sigh, you grip your makeshift wand firmly and concentrate. Gathering your focus, 
you point your rope and fork wand to the door and firmly encant "Alohomora!"

    The door begins to acquire a dim yellow-green glow emanating from the lock mechanism.
    Rattling sounds out from the door's keyhole as the door begins to rumble within, wood
    splintering as the sounds of grinding metal and wood fill the room. A horrible smell
    fills your nostrels and makes you gag.

        The door jars opens with a creak as the locking mechanism breaks.


        I cannot be happier that this github lesson is OVER!!!
