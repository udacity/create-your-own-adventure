You know this will not be easy, but the desperate longing for tacos drives you forward.

"They're here. In the kitchen..." 

Your mom's voice [taunts](../advice_from_mother/advice_from_mother.md) you, but you know better; you know all the tacos have gone.

You wonder for a moment, "Perhaps [Captain America](../captain/captain.md) was right. Perhaps it was the polar bear..."

You shake it off, "Polar bears don't eat tacos, they only eat [marshmallows](../polar-bear/polar-bear.md)"
and you continue toward the kitchen to fill your napsack with humble trailmix before continuing onward. 

You make it to the pantry, open the door and [suddenly](../unnatural_door/unnatural_door.md)!

You slam the door shut before getting sucked in. Your stomach growls even louder.

"Shut it will you?"

You realize your talking to your stomach again. This is not a good sign. Perhaps ease the nerves
with a brief [meditation](../meditation/meditation.md)?

"No. Meditation is for the weak. I must find the tacos."

You're really starting to sound like a fool at this point but continue on, undeterred. 

"Was the adventure to find the tacos? Or were the tacos fuel for the adventure?" 

You can't be sure at this point, so you answer the question with the only five letters that ever mattered
to you, your mother and your father, "[T-A-C-O-S](http://www.giphy.com/embed/E3LVWp4nRbFrW)."
