You grab out your cell phone - it's the best cell phone, of course 
and you scroll down to "Dept of Defence" in your contacts. "Hey guys, I've given it 
a lot of thought and decided hey, let's **** up China. 
Send a couple of nukes their way."

"Sweet," says the guy on the other end. 
"Those Chinese sons of b****es are going down"

So while it's on it's way, China freaks the hell out and fires some right back at America.

What the heck did you think was going to happen, you nutjob?
