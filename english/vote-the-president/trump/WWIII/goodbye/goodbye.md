Fareed is your coworker who once called you a racist for saying that Islam is incompatible with western values. You are not. You were just quoting Sam Harris. 
YOu call him:"HA HA Fareed, now you can go back to your muslim country!"
He explained to you he is Indian born in the US and raised Sikh, although he is not particulary religious. You are confused but happy.
