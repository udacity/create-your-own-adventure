After the wall is completed, President Trump sends Mexico a bill for $8 billion to Mexico.
Mexico doesn't like that, and declares war on the U.S.
The rest is downhill from here...

You wake up confused and realize it was just a dream. After all, you never really believed he was going to build a wall.
 You relax and turn on the TV.
You are shocked about REAL events:
Trump has threatened Mexico with 20% tariff on goods. 
He has threatened the UN by "taking names" of countries who don't support him. 
Signed a entry ban on muslim countries. 
Pushed Crazy Bannon in to NSC. And fired people who oppose him.
You soon realize things are going EXACTLY as the crazy liberals predicted.

	This is exactly what you wanted! Shake the government! This is Trumpland now!

	Although you have always been a republican, you feel in your heart something is out of place. You are heartbroken by the images of a Syrian 5yr old being detained.
