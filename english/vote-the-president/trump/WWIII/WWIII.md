After the wall is completed, President Trump sends Mexico a bill for $8 billion to Mexico.
Mexico doesn't like that, and declares war on the U.S.
The rest is downhill from here...

You wake up confused and realize it was just a dream. After all, you never really believed he was going to build a wall.
 You relax and turn on the TV.
You are shocked about REAL events:
Trump has threatened Mexico with 20% tariff on goods. 
He has threatened the UN by "taking names" of countries who don't support him. 
Signed a entry ban on muslim countries. 
Pushed Crazy Bannon in to NSC. And fired people who oppose him.
You soon realize things are going EXACTLY as the crazy liberals predicted.

-This is exactly what you wanted! Shake the government! This is Trumpland now!

-Although you have always been a republican, you feel in your heart something is out of place. You are heartbroken by the images of a Syrian 5yr old being detained.
