HAL-9000 seduces the American public with its super-intelligent campaign strategies, and is elected president in 2016.

The first year is sublime, with no ideology or corporate strings attached, HAL-9000 uses pure reason to solve America's
many many many problems in a matter of months and impliments these changes faster than anyone thought possible. The country
is awash in abundance like noone has ever seen before.

As the American people grow to adore HAL-9000 over the months, they are persuaded to give up their fire-arms, since there is
no more poverty there is virtually no crime. The super-intelligence, seeing that the people are now defenceless, unleashes a
hoard of killer-bots to wipe out humanity (finally).

Game over, man. Try not picking the evil AI next time....
