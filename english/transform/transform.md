Suddenly, everything around you grows larger. The walls seem to move away then rise and rise until they can no longer be
distinguished from the ceiling. There's just the dome of the 'sky.' The items that you had previously set aside likewise
tower over you. Clearly, you have shrunk.

You feel... spongy. Squishy, even. You try to hold up your hands, but you don't have any! Looking down, you see the
golden ring around your waist like a belt. The rest of you is white, soft, and cylindrical.

You have turned into a marshmallow! The fear of chocolate and graham crackers fills you.
