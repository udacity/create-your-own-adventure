You wake up, and everything seems normal but its not. You look look down and realize youre wearing a pink floral skirt, and there is a bunny near your toe. A bunny?  You look around and realize that you are not in your room. Infact you are not anywhere you recognize. You are in a hall with big brown walls, with upside down vases, color dripping from the walls, and a dressing table with some portions. You try to take in the weird sight of your surroundings.
You try to place your hand on the bunny.
The bunny runs away.
