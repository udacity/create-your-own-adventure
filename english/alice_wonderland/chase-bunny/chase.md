As you begin chasing the bunny, you realize that your surroundings start to change. Colours seem more brighter somehow, and everything transforms into a cartoonish montage.

You lose sight of the bunny, and you sigh and come to a halt.
You look around for any sign of life, anyone who could explain whats going on.
Then a beaver walks up to you and asks, "are you new to wonderland, dear?"
