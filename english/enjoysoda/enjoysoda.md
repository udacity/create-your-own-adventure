You cool your jets by taking a refreshing drink of your favorite soda.
While drinking your soda, you start to feel somewhat dizzy. Before you
can grab to your thoughts you fall to the ground but barely  manage to
keep your eyes open. Suddenly an orc raises you and puts your light body up
on his muscular and slimy shoulder. By the time he does his third step
you're already passed out.

You are awoken by a loud roar. When your vision returns you find yourself lying on your back against the ground. You see two Orcs standing over you shouting at one another. One of the Orcs slugs the other.
