Noticing that the marshmallow wants to get the lighter

you hold it out and pretend to look away. As the marsh hand 

reaches for the lighter you quickly jab the fork into the 

white fluffy hand. The marshmallow pulls back its hand and

a giant gaping mouth appears and starts to scream.  The 

scream starts to melt your face.
