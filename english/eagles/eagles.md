You realize the bird sound is actually the giant eagles from the Hobbit. You call out over
and over until your voice is hoarse. The creepy little marshmellow moves closer into the light.
Just when it feels all hope is lost, the ceiling to the room is torn off and a giant set of talons
pluck the marshmellow, now inches from your face, and toss it away like the lump of fluffy sugar
it is. Then the talons tear your restraints and wrap around your torso.

With a thump of its wings, the eagle is airborn, the wind hitting you in the face. Higher you fly. 
Looking down, the world is white with the fluffy marshmellows.

You close your eyes and fall asleep
