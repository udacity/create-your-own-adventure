The North will not be accounted for by a theory of The North.

[You will try to confront The North](../explore-outside/journey-to-flaming-tower/start-running/confront/confront.md), 
but when you go to find it, it will have paid your bill and left. No, it's not in the bathroom.

The North is sometimes a [Greyhound experience](../explore-outside/journey-to-flaming-tower/jellybus/jellybus.md): 
uncofortable, expensive, sleepless, and surrounded by wolves.

You will start to tell stories about The North, but you will end up telling stories
about [yourself.](../tweet-it/tweet-it.md)
