You start with a funky [canned heat by Jamiroquai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE4VlA_9OrI).
The audience loves it. You play some more groovy numbers and end with the classic
[Aeroplane by Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFk2RTxoE8).

Just as you are finishing the solo, you snap the G string which hits you in the eye
and you feel pain and hear the audience laughing at you. To your relief, it is a
dream and you [realize this is a dream.](../is-this-a-dream/is-this-a-dream.md)

Not wanting a similar experience at your big concert later that day, you [start practicing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0gcbmGpdGg)
