You start witch a funky [canned heat by Jamiroquai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7lSfg6QR78).
The audience loves it. You play some more groovy numbers and end with the classic
[Aeroplane by Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpFk2RTxoE8).

Just as you are finishing the solo, you snap the G string which hits you in the eye
and you feel pain and hear the audience laughing at you. To your relief, it is a
dream and you [realize this is a dream.](../is-this-a-dream/is-this-a-dream.md)
