Team Ironman believes that superheroes need to be looked over by
a governing body that decides when their services are needed. While 
this may suck for superheroes who just want to save the innocent, the 
Sokovia Accords allows the superheroes to blame the UN in case of unexpected
damage and civilian casualties. Congratulations on choosing Team Ironman.
