After eating marshmellows i can't get no sleep. Freaky noises make my
skin creep. I can't get no sleep.
I try some tea, it gets me nowhere.
It's probably because the marshmellows where filled with horse hooves
It's definitely throwing off my groove:(
Then I open my mac and log on to udacity :)
But I eat horse hooves all the time and it doesn't keep me awake, maybe these are organic marshmallows.
