After eating marshmellows i can't get no sleep. Freaky noises make my
skin creep. I can't get no sleep.
I try some tea, it gets me nowhere.
It's probably because the marshmellows where filled with horse hooves
It's definitely throwing off my groove:(
Then I open my mac and log on to udacity,
All I see are lessons that can help me :)
Distraction is a foe.
But where am I? I do not know.
