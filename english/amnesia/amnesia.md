After eating marshmellows i can't get no sleep. Freaky noises make my
skin creep. I can't get no sleep.
I try some tea, it gets me nowhere.
It's probably because the marshmellows where filled with horse hooves
It's definitely throwing off my groove:(
Then I open my mac and log on to udacity,
All I see are lessons that can help me :)
Distraction is a foe.
But where am I? I do not know.

Amnesia can be freaking awesome sometimes :)

Or it can be highly disturbing.

Or, it can be highly... oh, I forgot what I was going to say.

Who am I?  Where am I?  What am I doing?
