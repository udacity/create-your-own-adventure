  You climb aboard the neon yellow rust bucket, once a part of the great School Bus fleet before the beginnings of the 
 Third Heliocentric Retro-Orbital War uprising, commonly referred to as THROW up. As the acrid odour of garlic pills and 
 intestinal bile begin to emmanate from the seat cushions, a rather frazzled and exuberant woman claiming to be a Ms. 
 Grizzle attempts to purlion your wallet for coins she believe will cure her Thomas' gout. Another person emerges, a stout patron 
 saint of this particular bus ride, dressed in the finest white orderly clothes, identifies himself as gender neutral and as the 
 keeper of the mentally unfit on "this here bus." The orderly orderly asks if you are Mr. Drumpf, as he is the last patient 
 required to take this marvelous journey to Moscow, you state you are not and quickly shuffle to the exit.
