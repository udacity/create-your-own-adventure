You raise your head. "Where am I...", you ask.
It feels as though you've lived a thousand lives. You can vaguely remember them, but just as you start to reach for them in the corners of your mind, they vanish.

Your eyes slow regain their focus, and you take a look around the dark unfamiliar space. A few items catch your attention...


[You see an old chess board. "Have I played this before", you ask yourself. ](../chess/chess.md)

[You notice a cup of coffee on the table. "How is there still steam coming from the cup? Did I make this or did someone else? How long was I asleep?", you question.](../coffee/coffee.md)

[A mysterious mirror beckon you from a distance. "Something feels wrong about that mirror", you think to yourself. ](../mirror/enter-mirror.md)
