It dawns upon you that you could be inside a gluten-sensitive marshmellow stomach so you begin to search for your 
box of Wheat Thins. Voila! There they are! Immediately you grind the salty gluten crackers into a fine powder and smear 
them all over the intestinal marshmellow walls.  Sure enough, within seconds, the gooey walls begin to frighfully 
tremble with a horrible thunder. Boom!! You're ejected so fast from the marshmellow creature that it takes an hour 
to regain your vision. You find yourself next to a rusty dumpster in Times Square.  The dumpster smells better than you.
