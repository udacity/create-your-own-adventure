You stare off, out and into yourself. You see the emptiness that is your life 
and fullness of your experience. You are nothing and all. Why must you be? 
What would be if you weren't? Whom might you be? Where did this toast come 
from? Is this real butter or are you just imagining it to be. You can't belive 
it's not butter! You won't belive it, they can't make you!

It's all closing in! Closing around you, the walls move. Inch by ince. They 
urge you to accept their reality! 

"It is not butter. Its jam they seem to tell you."

"NO! You are a wall, I won't listen to no stinkin wall!", you shout! 

The walls inch forward...

"It's too creamy to be--!"

and then silence.
