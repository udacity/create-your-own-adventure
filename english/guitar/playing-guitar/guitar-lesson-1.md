Identify the parts of the guitar. Whether you're playing an electric or an acoustic guitar, the instrument is 
essentially wood and metal. Copper-wound strings vibrate to create sound. The wooden body resonates that sound 
to create the warm tones we associate with a guitar.
The strings run between the headstock of the guitar, where they are affixed to tuning pegs that can be rotated 
to tighten and slacken them, and the bridge, where they're fixed to the guitar's body. On an acoustic guitar, 
the strings are fixed to the bridge with removable pegs, and on an electric guitar the strings are generally 
strung through an eyelet.
The neck of the guitar is the long wooden piece of wood, flat on one side (this is called the fretboard) and 
curved on the other. The fretboard is inlaid with metal frets that demarcate the different notes.
An acoustic guitar will have a sound hole in the body where the sound will resonate, while an electric guitar 
will have as many as three magnetic pickups which will channel the sound through an amplifier.
