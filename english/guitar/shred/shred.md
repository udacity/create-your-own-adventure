You play every Dethklok song you can remember from Metalocalypse
and melt every face within a hundred mile radius.
You then attempt to play Free Bird in its entirety but fall asleep a half-hour in...

  You didn't fall asleep cause the song sucks, but because your ambien kicked in
and you took a lot of it. For somereason, you see two doors. One that says
"Start dreaming", one that says 'The other stuff'. You choose:

[Start dreaming](../../dream/dream.md)
[The other stuff](../../otherStuff/otherStuff.md)
