You notice that the walls are beginning to melt, but fortunately
your trusty Giant Schnauzer has just arrived. 

And he. Is. Hungry. 

He begins to eat at the walls, chomping at them with his powerful (yet adorable) jaws. 

Great! You're free! 

Now, you're faced with a choice. 

Do you stop, and [get his majestic beard cleaned?](beard-groom/beard-groom.md).

Do you [keep going](nap/nap.md), and hope that he won't decide to take a nap? 

Or

Do you head to the shops to fetch some [graham crackers and chocolate?](insulin/insulin.md).
