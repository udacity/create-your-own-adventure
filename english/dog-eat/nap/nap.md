You decide to keep going. 
But you forget that your dog is naturally
a slow, yet majestic, beast. 

He begins to tire. His epicly big schnozzle has detected a piece of 
moldy bread on the ground. 

And then- he realizes that there is a couch calling his name. 

He is powerless to resist. 

He pulls you by your pant leg to the couch, forces you to sit, 
and then throws himself down upon you for a nap. 

Soon, he is snoring epically, and his cuteness is so 
overwhelming that you cannot ask him to move. 

Not wanting to disturb him, you forget to shower, use the toilet, or eat food. 
And you die and become a mummy. But damn, that dog is cute.
