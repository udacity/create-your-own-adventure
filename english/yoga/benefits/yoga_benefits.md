Yoga is a great way to work on your flexibility and strength. Just 
about everyone can do it, too -- it's not just for people who can 
touch their toes or want to meditate.

Some types of yoga are about relaxation. In others, you move more. 
Most types focus on learning poses, called asanas. They also usually 
include attention to breathing.
