Yoga Lifestyle

Yoga lifestyle is about one’s internal values:
What moves or motivates a person to do what they do?

Yoga lifestyle is also about the process:
How one goes about performing their daily actions.
That person can be an artist, a carpenter, a construction worker,
a plumber, a car mechanic, a yoga teacher, or a cop.
These external descriptions are like the seasons in New England – 
they are in constant change.

They describe a temporary occurrence. Our essence remains the same.
Our core values determine who we are and if we are living a yoga
lifestyle.

Yoga lifestyle is about two actions: "cleaning the mirror" and
"spreading the light".
