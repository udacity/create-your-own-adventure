The ultimate goal of Yoga is liberation though the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated.

According to Jacobsen, "Yoga has five principal meanings:

1. Yoga as a disciplined method for attaining a goal;
2. Yoga as techniques of controlling the body and the mind;

4. Yoga in connection with other words, such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-," referring to traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga;
