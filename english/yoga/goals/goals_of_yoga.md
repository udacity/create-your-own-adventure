Goals of Yoga

The ultimate goal of Yoga is liberation though the exact definition
of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological
system with which it is conjugated.

A more simpler goal of yoga is to stay fit and healthy. But beyond sweat
and a few classes a week, yoga is meant to liberate you by helping you
to discover your inner self and gain peace.

Peace on earth as it is in heaven.

A perfect harmony between mind and body.
