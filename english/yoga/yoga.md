Yoga originated in India.

Starting out in child pose, you start to zoom out from the environment and take focus on your breathing.

Yoga is good for the boy and soul.

There are many types of yoga - Ashtanga, Bikram, Sivananda, Iyengar etc.

Going through the poses, you feel your body warm up and you feel the energy flowing through your body.

Calm music starts to play quietly from all directions.

Please relax. I can’t emphasise that enough. All of us experience stress, whether you’re a heart surgeon making vital incisions, or just Dave Bloggs queuing for a rail ticket behind a man who’s buying a travel pass, which involves photographs, scissors, forms being filled in, and his access won’t wipe. You get the picture. Stress like this just won’t go away, and it has to be combated.

Suddenly a large beast appears from the shadows and starts terrorizing the village.

You start becoming transcendent.
