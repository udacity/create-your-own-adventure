The Egyptian revolution of 2011, locally known as the January 25 Revolution and as the Egyptian Revolution of Dignity,
began on 25 January 2011 and took place across all of Egypt. The date was set by various youth groups to coincide with
the annual Egyptian "police day" as a statement against increasing police brutality during the last few years of Mubarak's presidency.
