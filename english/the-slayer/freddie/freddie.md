his chocolate stick.

As the terrible marshmallow lay heaped on the floor, he wheezed a final threat at Freddie,
"You think you've won.  You think you've defeated me.  But there s'more."

Freddie stood over the terrible marshmallow, trying to think of a witty retort.
Nothing was coming to his head.  There was only one thing left to do.
