You unpack your porta-bed that you got from [Costco](http://www.costco.com).

And lay your head on the [MyPillow](http://www.mypillow.com) that you bought 
while you were recovering from an epic night of binge watching.  You drift off
to slumber land thinking...man that My Pillow guy has one hell of a moustache.

In other news, you realized that you could sleep quite comfortably
without a pillow. On the tangent of minimalist travel, you decided
to watch the BBC Documentary, "American Nomads", reviewed on IMDB [here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2118568/).
