It's 10 p.m. and you're borging, and decide to surf on google, for stacraft 1,

an old game that you play some years ago, suddenly you read starcraft 2

a new version with beter graphics and you give it a chance again

visiting [Starcraft 2](http://www.starcraft2.com)

After downloading Star Craft 2, you start playing the campaign and

you find it to be the best RTS campaign you've ever played.  You had

so much fun playing it that you play through it twice more.

But then you realise that StarCraft 1 is better, even more so

Brood War is where it's at. And so you train for days, and a few more

days. And then a few more. After 1337 days, you are finally Grandmaster

and enter GSL.
