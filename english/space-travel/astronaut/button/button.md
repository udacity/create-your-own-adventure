After entering the space elevator in elation at the adventures you are bound to
experience, you settle into a sobering insecurity at your recent life choices
while staring at the massive elevator button panel.  You quickly realize you
have no idea what button to push, where you should go, what to do when you get
there, how to use a space toilet, or why you made any of the choices for the
past 2 decades.

Suddenly, after looking at the panel for far too long, you hear a commanding
voice coming near you say "Please hold the elevator!".  You look up and see Dale
Tremane, captain of the space station.

He confidently walks into the elevator, stands next to, tells the AI "Upper deck
please", turns to you and says "Thanks".

Do you:

Stare forward and sink deeper into your insecurity...
 
Respond to Captain Tremane...
