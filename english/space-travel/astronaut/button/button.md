As soon as you press the button the light in the elevator turns red and I siren starts blaring. 

No one presses buttons in the modern world, the probability of viral infection are too high and who wants to use old tech anyways??

You realise that this was a test and you failed. There's no space for cave man in... space.

You exit the elevator and get back to being [earthbound](../../earthborn/earthborn.md).
