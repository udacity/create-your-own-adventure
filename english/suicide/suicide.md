You feel a madness take hold of your mind
and slowly you pull your knife out of it's sheath.

You stare into the mirror edge of your knife
you see a frown upon your face and decide to fix it.

Laughing maniacally you cut at the corners of your mouth
feeling the blood trickling down your face.

You fall to the floor, your vision begins to
fade and everything becomes shrouded in darkness

You die smiling from ear to ear.

The End.
