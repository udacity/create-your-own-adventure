As you open the box, you see a bright light coming out of it. You try looking through the blinding white and barely see a gimple of yourself, there just lying lifeless on the bottom. And then it strikes you, how can you be dead inside the box and be looking at your own corpse from outside? In that very moment of enlightenment, the cosmos begin to collapse as your self-awareness absorbs your surroundings. Your heart beats really fast and a second later you open your eyes, terrified of what you might see. Only to find out you have been dreaming all this time. You look around and find yourself in a hospital room, with a plate full of marshmallows lying on the table beside you.
