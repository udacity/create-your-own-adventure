You stand the cat upright and measure it.  Then you lay it on its side and measure its height again.  You find it's an inch taller when measured on its side and the cat is actually alive.

Since your measurement did not include an accuracy component you conclude that the standing cat was dead within the bounds of the newly computed accuracy.  [Its stench is growing](stinking-cat).

The cat appears to move and you try to measure its speed.
You remember Heisenberg and realize you messed up the whole thing.
You try to very quickly measure its height and speed successively but the measurements become erratic.
The cat [disappears](cat-disappears)...
