It takes some effort, but you are eventually able to push the rope into the wall so that it resembles a wick in a 
marshmallow candle. You decide to position the wick near the ground, hoping that the flame will melt the 
marshmallow and hollow out a tunnel you can crawl through.

As the flames lick the marshmallow, the entire room begins to tremor and convulse, as if it actually feels the flame. 
Trying not to be distracted by your sudden craving for S'mores, you begin to wonder if this was a good idea. 

The walls begin to cramp in towards you, and the room begins to fill with smoke from the fire. 

Do you:

[Cover your nose with your shirt and hope the fire burns through the marshmallow soon](wait/wait.md)
