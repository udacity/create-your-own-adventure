You decide to stick with your original plan of burning your way out of the marshmallow room.
You cover your nose and mouth with your shirt to try and keep the smoke out of your lungs. 
The smoke grows thicker and darker, accompanied by the sickeningly sweet smell of roasted 
marshmallow. The room's convulsions knock you to the floor as the walls compress tightly around you.
The smoke is starting to burn your throat, and you start to lose consciousness.


Suddenly, the room expands beyond it's original size, and then the floor flexes upward rapidly while 
the walls compress. You are thrown upwards through a tunnel that has opened in the top of the room. 

As you fly through the air, you groggily wonder if you've really just been coughed out of a giant 
living marshmallow creature. 

You realize you've begun your descent, and are falling into a large forest.
