You scrape some jelly beans off the wall, find a makeshift bowl and use your lighter
to melt them. Next you mix in some of the melted marshmallow behind you and stir. You
notice it looks a bit like melted ice cream which disgusts you. Next, you gulp
the mixture down and, a few seconds later, vomit. You feel better but different. Not
sick or queasy but things around you don't appear the same.
