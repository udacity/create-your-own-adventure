As you sprint into the next room, you realize that now all of the walls are
covered with jelly beans.

You try one. This doesn't taste like a jelly bean, yuck! You start to feel
dizzy, however, and nearly fall down. You think you may have been poisoned
and start thinking... is there an antidote?

Do you:

[Melt some jelly beans with the lighter, mix it in with the melted marshmallow](melt-jelly-beans/melt-jelly-beans.md)

[Light jelly bean wall on fire, see if anything is of use behind it](light-jelly-bean-wall/light-jelly-bean-wall.md)

[Stand and wait, maybe it isn't a poison after all](stand-and-wait/stand-and-wait.md)
