You light the jelly bean wall closest to you on fire and watch as it quickly melts
down. There is another room behind it and you can see a table with a can of soda on
top of it. It's red like a Coca-Cola but has just an "A" on the label. That could
mean "antidote" but you check the can for ingredients and you find none listed.
