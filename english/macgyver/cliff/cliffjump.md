Knowing the fate of the world rested on your shoulders and knowing 
there is no possible way out it you decide to jump off the cliff.

In a dash, you throw the marshmallow at your exgirlfriend and bail.

During free fall, with only seconds to live, your mind races when 


suddenly:
You realize that your exgirlfriend has a jet-pack prototype and
she's coming at you for payback!
