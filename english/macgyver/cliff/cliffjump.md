Knowing the fate of the world rested on your shoulders and knowing
there is no possible way out it, you decide to jump off the cliff.

The mere thought of existence seems like an anti-climax of a bad story.
You have lost your girlfriend, and ended up with a marshmallow. And as
yummy as marshmallows are, they'll never replace that special place in
your heart that your ex-girlfriend held. You realize there's only one thing
to do:

In a dash, you throw the marshmallow at your ex-girlfriend and bail.

But then you realize that you forgot your parachute!

During free fall, with only seconds to live, your mind races when


suddenly:
You realize that your ex-girlfriend has a jet-pack prototype and
she's coming at you for payback!

As you plummet off the cliff, you catch her eye and in that split second you realize:

[Even though you broke her heart, she doesn't want you to die](rescued/rescued.md)

[She is raising her arm to hurl the marshmallow back, let you fall, and take charge of marshmallow land](fall/fall.md)
