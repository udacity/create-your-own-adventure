Knowing the fate of the world rested on your shoulders and knowing
there is no possible way out it, you decide to jump off the cliff.

In a dash, you throw the marshmallow at your ex-girlfriend and bail.

But then you realize that you forgot your parachute!

During free fall, with only seconds to live, your mind races when


suddenly:
You realize that your ex-girlfriend has a jet-pack prototype and
she's coming at you for payback!
