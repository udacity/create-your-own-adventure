After realizing that the marshmallow may be self-aware, you want to confirm your suspision by delivering a Turing test. 

You scream inside the belly of the beast "Hello! What do you call yourself?"

At first you hear no response. And then, a deep rumble comes from all around. 

"Stay Puft" 

Do you:

[Realize that you are in the Ghostbusters movie and wait for the marshmallow to explode] (ghostbusters/ghostbusters.md)

[Be left clueless by this reference and try to eat your way out](eat/eat.md)

[Understand that you need Ghostbusters, and build a stay puft marshmallow man] (../staypuft/marshmallowman.md)

[Assume you're on a prank show and begin looking for Ashton Kutcher] (prank/prank.md)

[Go Super Saiyan to roast the marshmallow with a Kamehameha] (dragonball/dragonball.md)

[Ask ELIZA, who just happens to be running on a nearby terminal] (eliza/ask_eliza.md)
