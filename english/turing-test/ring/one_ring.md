You hurriedly take the ring of power out of your pocket and put it on.

The marshmellows are bewildered by your vanishing act and frantically hop
around searching for you.

Meanwhile, you descry your surroundings for escape routes.

You eventually realize that tickling the walls makes the whole room to rumble and cracks start appearing in the walls.

The cracks in the walls grow larger and larger until they form a doorway big enough for you to walk thorugh.

A shrill sound almost like someone scraping their fingernails on a chalkboard emanates from the doorway,
growing louder with each passing moment.
