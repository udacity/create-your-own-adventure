The ghostbusters eventually blow up the marshmallow man and you fly off in a huge explosion.

Marshmallow cushions your fall and you have safely escaped the danger. 
A sudden awareness of a broken and marshmallow strewn Central Park breaks upon you.  Your real work has just begun.
Congrats for completing the adventure!
