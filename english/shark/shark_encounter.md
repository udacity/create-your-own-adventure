That was the first time I went surfing in La Jolla Beach, San Diego.
The weather was so nice but there were not a lot of people. We were out there in the line up. There was a lady swam by and she talked to my friend "Did you see that shark, it was like eight foot long."
My friend looked at me and he said "Ok! I am gonna put my feet on the board." It was funny since they were very calm like that. I was a bit worry but since they stayed in the water, I decided to stay too.
I enjoyed riding a couple waves and then I saw it. It was the biggest fish I had ever faced that close. It swam calmly like a submarine across my board. I was a bit terrified by realized it was not the dangerous kind. It was a huge yellow leopard shark which is a bottom feeder. It was a thrilling moment because of its size.
Couple day after, the local news reported that the shark did bite someone's toe.
