#Rewrite your symphony

You pick up your cat.  Scratch the head until it purrs.

You are motivated again.

You set the cat down and begin to re-write your symphony with better ink and no liquids in sight.

As soon as the pen touches paper a low roar begins to build in your mind. 

What started off as slight discomfort quickly grows into rythmic pain.

You fall to the floor, hands futily massasing your temples in tight circles.

Staring at the floor from your knees you feel the cat walking over your calves and into view. 

He sits methodically and slowly turns to look you in the eye.

The sound grows until you're certain the constant pounding is going to make your head explode!

Everything goes dark.

You wake on your back, the cat kneeding gently into your chest.

His face must be close to yours, his breath is warm on your face.

As you open your eyes your vision is filled by two golden orbs.

You hear a voice like none you've ever heard before.

"It is time to make a choice," it says.

The orbs receed from your vision, and the rest of the cat's face is revealed.

"Where did it get a top hat from?" you wonder.

He gives you a stern look as he adjusts his monocle, and the strange voice repeats, 

["It is time to make a choice."](../time-machine/time-machine.md)
