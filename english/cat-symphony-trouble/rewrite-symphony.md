#Rewrite your symphony

You pick up your cat.  Scratch the head until it purrs.

You are motivated again.

You set the cat down and begin to re-write your symphony with better ink and no liquids in sight.

Annoyed, you get up, put the cat on the floor,
find your car keys and and start making your way to the store to buy the essentials.

Your cat is not happy to be left alone.
