#Rewrite your symphony

You pick up your cat.  Scratch the head until it purrs.

You are motivated again.

You set the cat down and begin to re-write your symphony with better ink and no liquids in sight.

The cat has other ideas. She stares imperiously at you. When your attention
doesn't waver from the page, she swiftly bats over the vase of roses.
Water spills across the symphony.
