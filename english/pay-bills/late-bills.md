Oh! It looks like you have forgotten to pay one or more of your [bills](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bill?s=t)!

Now those bills are late. You should know there are [consequences](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-happens-if-dont-pay-credit-card-bill/) to not paying your bills on time.

I do not think you should [quit your job](https://github.com/udacity/create-your-own-adventure/blob/master/english/quit-your-job/quit-your-job.md) just yet. How would you pay these bills off?!
