It seems like the only thing to do is code.

You create a program that is designed to make your pants stop glowing.  It works.
Your pants stop glowing, but then the marshmallow-walled room starts glowing,
slowly getting brighter and brighter.

You continue coding.

one day i got bored with the stuff so i created an algorithm to add some color
and randomness.

Then I decided to change the transparency of the
marshmallows to 50%.

This also worked!

You then decide to change the transparency program to slowly alternate between 100% and 25%.

Some time passes and an opportunity arises to [follow your destiny.](../destiny/destiny.md) 

This is always easier whenever you drink [coffee!](../coffee/coffee.md) 

Sometime I code and for fun I play or watch soccer.
