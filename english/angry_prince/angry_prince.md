There once was a prince who was angry.

It was war time and he had a lot of duties to do. But his rumbling rage was too weak to handle.

He decided to take the biggest sword in the kingdom.

It was this [sword](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ICatpGotaNs/maxresdefault.jpg).

Satisfied with the sword, He asked for the craftsman to come in his palace to kill him.

Little did he know, that sword will change everything he knows....

But more on that later. For now, the prince must tend to his royal duties.
