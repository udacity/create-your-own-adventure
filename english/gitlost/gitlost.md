You find yourself lost in a GitHub tutorial....

Look around, what do you see? Lots of windows open

* Your Terminal
* GitHub in one browser
* GitHub in a different browser
* GitGub Desktop
* A YouTube browser showing other tutorials you might watch to help get unstuck

You are psyched that you found [Linus Torvalds presenting Git to Googlei](https://youtu.be/4XpnKHJAok8) and insulting their
stupidity the whole time,
to get them to adopt Git as their version control system.

You are nearly finished with the Tutorial but now you are lost on your own branch,
compelled to write part of an adventure game! 

"Help!  How to I get out of here???"  

It is as easy as just hitting escape. ESC. On the upper left of the keyboard. Remember VI?
Then just colon-w-q. Stage it, commit it. 

But then what?  Push? Merge? Pull request?  Need to go back and watch the tutorial again and
figure it out.  Will I ever finish??
