Now that you've made a good life desicion and decided to work out, you now must
choose your method. Do you:

Work that cardiovascular system by going for a [run](run/run.md)?

Or...

Attempt to get super swole by lifting some [weights](weights/weights.md)?

or.... 

have a lot of fun while doing some [dance](dance/worldDanz.md)

like [this:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bt_LhpFswg)?!!!
