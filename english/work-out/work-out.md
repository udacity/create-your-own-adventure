Now that you've made a good life desicion and decided to work out, you now must
choose your method. Do you:

Work that cardiovascular system by going for a [run](run/run.md)? But if you have bad knees you might want to consider going for a [cycle](cycle.cycle.md)) instead? Some people find cycling much more fun due to the speed and there being no impact!?

Or...

Attempt to get super swole by lifting some [weights](weights/weights.md)?

Or......

maybe a [personal trainer](personal-trainer/personal_trainer.md)
