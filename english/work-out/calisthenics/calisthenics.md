You go to the park.

It's a sunny day. Blue skies.

People are running.

Ladies are walking their dogs.

Children are playing on the swing.

Then you think,

"[Playground](playground/playground.md) looks good for pull-ups"

"The soft [grass](grass/grass.md) is perfect for planking"

"[Benches](bench/bench.md) are great for box jumps"
