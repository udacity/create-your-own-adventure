You look for a nice shaded area under a tree.

The grass is dry but soft.

The surface is flat without any signs of rocks or roots.

You begin your plank holds. 1 minute.

You feel the burn in your core and lower back.

Next mountain climbers.

You go hard and intense, pushing against the ground, knees to chest.

You're at 95% maximum heart rate when you hear a voice.

It's a girl sunbathing right behind you,

"Hey there, nice form. Could I get a hand with this sunblock?"
