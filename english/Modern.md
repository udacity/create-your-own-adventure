In today’s modern age society with all the technology

around receiving help is far easier than what it use to be;

whether it’s seeking medical attention or therapeutic need.

With just a couple of clicks away one can search and find any

answer to literally any problem. Bearing this in mind, one

does not primarily know who the benefactor is, which leads

to a lack of trust and misguided information. By having a

highly educated religious person who one can turn to in time

of need will be easier to have faith in and trust their

judgement as oppose to a random stranger.
