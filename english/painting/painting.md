Casting your gaze down the hallway, one painting catches your interest. 
You walk up to the large painting, so big you could almost jump into it. 
It is of three strange looking black orbs with eyes, feet, and a strange hats. 
They are all marching single file in line on a nice sunny day with a few clouds in the background.
