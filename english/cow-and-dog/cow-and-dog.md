One day a dog was walking on the street and a cow was driving

The cow asked the dog "why are you walking like a dog?"

The dog: "because I'm a dog"

The cow: "can't you walk like a cow?"

The dog: "no because a cow don't walk like dog"

The cow: "I'm a cow and I'm asking you to walk like a cow"

The dog: "have you ever seen a cow walking? if you do you'll never walk like a cow"

The cow: "That's why I'm driving"
