You have decided to learn about grime! Grime is a genre originating from the
United Kingdom that mainly grew out of similar, older genres of electronic music
in the UK - primarily UK garage and jungle. Grime music is normally set at a
tempo of 140 beats per minute and feature dark basslines, futuristic electronic
noises, and an abundance of square waves. Grime is listened to both as stand-
alone instrumentals and with an MC, whose role in the genre has morphed from
something similar to the literal definition of "mic controller" to something
very similar to a modern hip-hop rapper. Grime is known for being fast,
agressive, and hard hitting and although many MCs have moved closer and closer
to a hip-hop sound, grime still maintains a distinct, underground sound.
