India is a country known for its unity in diversity. India is made up 
of innumerable and varied cultures that inhabit various regions of the 
country. Though this country is made up of over twenty States, each one 
having its own mother tongue, culture, traditions and art forms, these 
states have varied regional cultures. Every region has its own unique 
art forms, Hindi Shayri, poetry, prose, handicrafts, paintings, etc.

While there are varied musical forms, Indian classical music has been 
broadly divided into the north Indian tradition also known as 
Hindustani music and the Carnatic music belonging to south India. What 
differentiates the two is their arrangement and performance.
