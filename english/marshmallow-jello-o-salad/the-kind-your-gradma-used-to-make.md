You are suddenly reminded of thanksgiving dinners you had as a child at your Grandma's house and an overwhelming urge
comes over you to make one of those weird marshmallow Jell-O salads that you never liked.

Astonishingly, in your straightjacket pocket you find an orange Jell-O packet, a bowl, and a mixing spoon
(yes, straightjackets have big pockets). You pluck small pieces of marshmallow from the walls and make the weirdest
marshmallow Jell-O salad ever. You're not sure if you want to eat it.
