You are suddenly reminded of thanksgiving dinners you had as a child at your Grandma's house and an overwhelming
urge comes over you to make one of those weird marshmallow Jell-O fruit salads that you never liked.

Astonishingly, in your straightjacket pocket you find an orange Jell-O packet, some canned fruit, a bowl, and a
mixing spoon (yes, straightjackets have big pockets). You pluck small pieces of marshmallow from the walls and
prepare to make the weirdest marshmallow Jell-O fruit salad ever.

Some people have trouble after eating these

[You remember that these actually are really gross](gross/gross.md)

[You set aside the grossness as joyous feelings of nostalgia overcome you and
you wolf down a mouthful. Jumping with child like glee, the buoyant trampoline 
like floor bounces you straight through the blubbery roof.](bounce/bounce.md)
