Test Driven Development in terms of three simple rules. They are:


1) You are not allowed to write any production code 
unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.

2) You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test 
than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.

3) You are not allowed to write any more production code 
than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
