Hello world is commonly used as the first string to display when leaning to code.
Due to the popularity of this phrase, I decided to use it as my company's name.
Go [here](http://www.helloworldng.com) to visit my company.
Helloworldng.com is a research and software development agency serving clients in Nigeria.
The company also trains people on programming and online marketing.
