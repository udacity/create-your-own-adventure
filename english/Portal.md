You decide to take your chances with the portal. You gaze in to it's etheral magenta
form and wearily break in to a mad dash away from the Beholder. As you get closer,
you see crystaline forms glittering within the purple medium. You question your decision,
but anything is better than death. You take the leap and vanish into another realm.

Immediately, your party experiences a falling sensation. Flashes of glimmering light whiz
past your eyes as you fall. The wizard postulates that it may be stars since you're most
likely traveling through space in a wormhole. The lights spiral into a helix, with a
green circle at its base. Your team falls toward it rapidly and you hit the ground with
force. Your legs begin running until you stumble onto the ground and roll to a stop.

Each of you takes a small amount of damage, but not enough to kill you. While you gather
your senses, you begin to observe the realm that you've landed in. Vast forests and seas
surround you. You are at the tip of a high mountain. There is a trail leading toward the 
forests and a docked boat at the base of the hill.
As you gander at the countryside before you, you realize that you must make a choide.

Do you go towards the [forest](../PortalForest/Forest.md) or the [sea](../PortalSea/Sea.md)?
