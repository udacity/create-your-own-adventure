Suddenly you encounter a giant flying ship lying on the side, and you draw closer your heart starts beating fast. 
Wait, could it be? Could it really be the Millenium Falcon? As you pinch yourself and realize you're not dreaming, 
you now enter this giant ship and turn on the controls ! Fly way, you lucky brat, fly away !

"Hey Chewy, who's flying this infernal machine?" You
suddenly hear being asked from one of the dark corridors
off the cockpit. You're not alone!

You hear footsteps coming your way, you must decide to
[hide inside the doorway](hansolo/hansolo.md) and evade detection...

...or maybe you should [shoot first!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_shot_first)
