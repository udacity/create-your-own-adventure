You are overcome with existential dread. Who are you? What are these marshmallows doing here?
Should you take one now or will you get more later if you wait? What does that say about you
if you do? Overwhelmed by the possible implications of your actions and unable to confront
the fundamental questions they raise about the nature of self you curl into a ball and
stare at your belly button.
