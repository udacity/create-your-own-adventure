You suddenly teleport to a planet within the Andromeda Galaxy.

You are greeted by an unfamilar dark sky, followed by the sudden realisation that you are strangely breathing oxygen. You turn around and
see cloaked figures approaching you. They look human, but slightly thinner and taller with four arms.

As they get closer, you notice their pale complexion. There are three of them. They stop within several feet of you. There is a long pause.
Suddenly, the middle figure resumes his approach. He removes his hood and you notice that he is faceless. He stops right in front of you, and
you hear a thin, whispery voice within your head..
