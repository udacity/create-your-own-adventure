What should I do with this vacuum?
I think I should create the vacuum of space.
Then I could travel to anywhere in the Universe to my liking,
because I decided what to vacuum.

Speaking of the vacuum of space, 
in a weird gesture for attention, 
Elon Musk had his own personal cherry red Tesla Roadster 
sent into that vacuum of space on a $150 million+ rocketship.
