What should I do with this vacuum?
I think I should create the vacuum of space.
Then I could travel to anywhere in the Universe to my liking,
because I decided what to vacuum.

Oh no!  The vacuum appears to be broken...nothing happens when I press the power button.
Or maybe it's not broken after all, I forgot to plug it in!
Now if only I could find a power outlet around here somewhere.
As you are searching for a place to plug in your handy-dandy vacuum, 
you are hit in the back of the head and lose [consciousness](english/33hours/wakingup.md).
