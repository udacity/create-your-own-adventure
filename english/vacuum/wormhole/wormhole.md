You step out onto an alien landscape. The sky is a pale green. The air is thick
but you can breathe it. On the horizon you can see a small red sun setting, dim
enough that you can look straight at it. Looking around, in one direction you
can see the bright lights of what looks like a small city. In another direction
you can make out a few small structures that appear to be farmhouses and barns.
