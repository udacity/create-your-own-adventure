You find yourself face to face with the Froboznian police.

"Ouzna gotcha!" they bellow.

You deftly spin around the clumsy officer's hand and rush out the doorway on the
other side of the room.  You enter a huge, poorly lit cavern and desperately search
for an escape route.  You see a rickety bridge spanning a bottomless chasm.

[Take the Bridge] (../get-away/get-away.md)

The bridge sways and squeaks in the dusty, hot wind.
One step, and the dry wood feels like it's about to break
beneath your feet. "After him!" the froboznians scream behind you.
You brace yourself and run, as light on your feet as you can.
