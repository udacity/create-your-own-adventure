months ago. You then decide to whip up an awesome brownie batter for your
loved ones.

30 minutes later, the smell is astounding, and you realize that you do not
want to share this brownie batch with anyone. So, you make a terrific life
choice and eat all the brownies for yourself! No regrets, right?
