You step through the enchanted door and into Lego World!
But this world is a Lego version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
You are actually skiing down the slope of a marshmallow mountain made out of Legos!
You are surrounded by lollipop trees and gingerbread houses.
[Everything is awesome!](https://youtu.be/etzMjoH0rJw)
And you just can't help but bust out some dance moves
But oh wait! Suddenly a giant Lego platypus appears out of the chocolate river!  It starts waddling towards you...
Quick! Grab that [small pile of 6 2x4 LEGO bricks](fun/so-much-fun.md) you almost stepped on and start building with them!
