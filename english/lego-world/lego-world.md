You step through the enchanted door and into Lego World!
But this world is a Lego version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
You are actually skiing down the slope of a marshmallow mountain made out of Legos!
You are surrounded by lollipop trees and gingerbread houses. You can't help but burst into song!
[Everything is awesome!](https://youtu.be/etzMjoH0rJw)
