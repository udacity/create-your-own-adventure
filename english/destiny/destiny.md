you have decided to persue your destiny.

before you start you must have forgotten to pee so [go now](../eating-walls/find-a-toilet/find-a-toilet.md).

now that you are relieved of the pressure underneath.

you look so hard on the screen, the rooms seems colder and strange with something in it,

but it's too much to take on.

so you [go back to sleep](../sleep/marshmallow.md).

But you wake up and chose to find your way to know the [real life](../real-life/real-life.md).

see destiny isn't so hard when you try for it.

Look on it with soft eyes. Dont grasp at it. Dont plan for it.

Dont drive at it. Follow your gut today, for this hour. 

Work for the great people and with the great people.

Work for the ideas you belive in. 

Work for the future too. Yes work for the future and don't plan too much.

Work for today. 

Find something to work for.

and now you will be the [protagonist of the story](../marshmallow.md)

and I have [high hopes](../hope/hope.md) for you.

and you might be someone [who knocks](../say-my-name/say-my-name.md).

or perhaps you are someone [who opens](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A20).

If you have finished pursuing your destiny, it may be time for a 
[cold one](../drink-beer/drink-beer.md).

If you have only just begun to pursue your destiny, it's best not to
do so on an [empty stomach](../breakfast/breakfast.md). 

On second thought, it might be safer to just lie low.
 The world is a dangerous place and to so strike out into it might be dangerous.
