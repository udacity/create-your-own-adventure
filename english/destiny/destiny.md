you have decided to persue your destiny.

before you start you must have forgotten to pee so [go now](../eating-walls/find-a-toilet/find-a-toilet.md).

now that you are relieved of the pressure underneath.

you look so hard on the screen, the rooms seems colder and strange with something in it,

but it's too much to take on.

so you [go back to sleep](../sleep/marshmallow.md).

But you wake up and chose to find your way to know the [real life](../real-life/real-life.md).

see destiny isn't so hard when you try for it.

and now you will be the [protagonist of the story](../marshmallow.md)

and I have [high hopes](../hope/hope.md) for you.

and you might be someone [who knocks](../say-my-name/say-my-name.md).
