You hear someone shout "Yuha!". You have no idea what it means 
but you instantly realise that this scene isn't real. It's just a 
GitHub practice session! Sorry to spoil the fun. Now go and branch after you've 
forked your way out.
 
But if you want to keep playing (back into the maxtrix) go back to the [beginning](../marshmallow.md).

Or did they yell ["YOLO"](./yolo/yolo.md).

But if you hear "Bazooka", then you are really in trouble. YOu are in a multi-layered inception

No where to go, but if you push your head against the computer and yell "Bazooka" you might just be able to make it.
