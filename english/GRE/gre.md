I Scored 322 in GRE (Quants-167 , Verbal-155). GRE has a pattern and it can be hacked.

After watching a few videos on how to prepare for GRE I started my preparation by learning all the Common  and Basic level words from the GRE MAgoosh app. i also read a few articles from The New Yorker and Arts and Daily.com .

Then i started solving the Kaplan book which according to me is the best resource to prepare for GRE. I have always been good at math but in verbal section i had to put in some effort to comprehend the dense text at good enough pace. Kaplan provided me with tips to help me with that. I also completed the Vocabulary of Kaplan given at the back of the book. The interesting thing about the Kaplan Vocabulary is that words with similar meaning are grouped together.It makes it easy to remember them and is also very useful for solving Sentence Equivalence questions asked in GRE.

I would suggest just give as many mock tests as possible and make a note of the areas where you need improvement. Always read the explaination as to why an answer is correct. I seem to benefit the most from it as it gives me a sense of how i should have thought about a problem. It also helps to make a list of some tricks and important formulas for Math. For example, I noted the formula to get the total number of factors a number would have. I did that because doing so without the formula takes alot more time and chances of error increases.
