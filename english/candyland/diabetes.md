You light a small fire in the middle of the marshmallow room.

As the fire grows, a sweet aroma fills the room and the ceiling 
becomes ever so slightly brown just above the fire.

The marshmallow room started melting and you started seeing some 
colorful lights shining through.

Wait! But this is not any colorful lights you are seeing!  What 
appears before you is a rainbow colored Gumdrop Mountains!

Surrounding the Gumdrop Mountain are acres of Lollipop Woods where 
there's a forest of giant lollipops as tall as sequoia.

You wanted to taste all these sweetness around you, but damn you 
just realize you have diabetes.
