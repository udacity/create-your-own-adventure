You swim for the ship like your life depends on it!

You swim and you swim and don't seem to be making much progress...

However, now the ship has spotted you and is heading right in your direction!

You wave your tired arms in the air.

Will it loose track of you in the milkshake waves?

Something seems...odd about the ship.

It's yellow in color and the flag has a skull and crossbones on it.

Oh no, banana-boat pirates!
