The chocolate sprinkler extinguishes the burning marshmallow walls.

You start eating caramelized, chocolate-covered marshmallows.

As your binge subsides, you slow your gorging and spot a giant graham
cracker leaning in the corner.

After you're finished eating, you notice the sprinkler flooded the
basement, making a pool of chocolate. Do you:

[Head to the basement with graham cracker in tow](graham-cracker/graham-cracker.md)?

[Go back to sleep](../../sleep/more-sleep/more-sleep.md)?

[Go exploring outside](../../explore-outside/explore-outside.md)?

[Swim in the chocolate pool](basement-swim/basement-swim.md)?

[Call Wonka Construction](wonka-construction/wonka-construction.md)?

[Wait for the chocolate to solidify](solid-chocolate/solid-chocolate.md)?

[Go to market to buy some fruits to dip in the chocolate](going-to-market/going-to-market.md)?
