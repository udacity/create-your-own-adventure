Git is a very powerful version control system.

Unlike some other version control systems, you don't need to have access to 
'central repository' all the time. 

The beauty is you can work offline and make changes even while you are in a remote 
island without any internet connection.

Finally when you surface back home and have internet access, you can publish your
changes to GitHub and share with others.

The most important feature of GitHub (which is built on git) is it enables collaborative
development.
