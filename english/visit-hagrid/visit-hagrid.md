Hermione, Harry, and Ron saunter down to Hagrid's hut.
Before they even knock they are greeted by Fang's loud barking, prompting Hagrid to come to the door.
The gang is glad to see Hagrid's friendly face after a tough week.
They sit together drinking tea and politely nibbling on Hagrid's over-baked snacks.
Snape wanders in looking really drunk and smelling of whiskey.

Hermione responds by:

[Yelling](../yell-at-snape/yell-at-snape.md)

[Punching Snape](../punch-snape/punch-snape.md)

Snape fails to hide his shock at Herminoe's behaviour, and assumes she must be pre menstural, because he had heard women tend to act crazy at certains times of the month. 

"Snape, what can I do for you?" asks Hagrid cautiously. 

Harry and Ron glance at eachother warily. Hermione slumps down onto the sofa, breathing heavily. The tension in the air was palpable. 

"I am here to give Harry this..." Snape slurs, thrusting a rolled up piece of parchment into Harry's chest. 

Harry unfurls the parchment, with Ron peering over his shoulder and Hagrid looking perplexed, probably because he can't read. 

It said...
