Life is full of ambitions
set goals
achieve the goals
celebrate success
keep moving up higher
daily exercising physically and mentally
not realising every goal set
every achievement all add up to our age

Get a good education
a good job
marry
have children
good home
good cars
affordable holiday
and you keep getting older everyday

to make our world a better and beautiful place to live
