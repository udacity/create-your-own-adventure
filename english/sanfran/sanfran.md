Strolling down market street, friendly smiles to passerby.
Cold wind rustles minty green leaves.
Soft summer glows over the front sidewalks.
This is a season to remember.
I want to go for [a bike ride](bikeride/bikeride.md).

So I head down to Sports Basement
in the marina to pick up a bike.
I want a nice bike that will take
me over the [golden gate bridge](goldengate/goldengate.md)
into Marin.
