I walk to the harbor.
There are several bike rental shops available.
I choose one, and rent a bicycle.
The ride over the Golden Gate Bridge is wonderful,
and I snap a few pictures.

Then I realize that biking has made me slightly hungry. Shall I purchase 
a [burrito](burrito/burrito.md)?
Or should I continue riding?

Let's ride to the wonderful intersection of Haight and Fillmore.

Go to Bean There Cafe for some [Ginger Peachy Keen](ginger-peachy-keen/ginger-peachy-keen.md).

Go to Cafe Europa for some pork schnitzel

Go to the [Cafe du Soleil](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d802647-Reviews-Cafe_Du_Soleil-San_Francisco_California.html) for a delicious coffee and an outdoor seat.

Go to the [Duboce Park Cafe](duboce/duboce.md) for a smoothie.
