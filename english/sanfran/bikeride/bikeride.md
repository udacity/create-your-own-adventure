I walk to the harbor.
There are several bike rental shops available.
I choose one, and rent a bicycle.
The ride over the Golden Gate Bridge is wonderful,
and I snap a few pictures.

Then I realize that biking has made me slightly hungry. Shall I purchase 
a [burrito](burrito/burrito.md)?
Or should I continue riding?

Let's ride to the wonderful intersection of Haight and Fillmore.

Go to Bean There Cafe for some [Ginger Peachy Keen](ginger-peachy-keen/ginger-peachy-keen.md).

Go to Cafe Europa for some pork schnitzel
