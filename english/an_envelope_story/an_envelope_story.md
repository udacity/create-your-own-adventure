You saw a delivery from someone. It was a brown and small envelope, you wondered who wrote to you? You picked up the
envelope, opened the envelope and it says, 
"Dear friend, I wish you have a great summer! I know it is strange for me to
write a mail to you, espeically when I could send you an email. I felt that it is more personal, as you know that my
handwriting is terrible. I had to redo whole mail several times.

I am looking forward to see you in person again someday, my old friend.

Regards, your old friend"
