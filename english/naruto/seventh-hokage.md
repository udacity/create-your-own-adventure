Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of
Konohagakure.He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on 
the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be ostracised
by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining
Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's
acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.
In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals,
he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers,
and soon after, the rest of the world. He soon proved to be one of
the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading
him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage
(七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).
