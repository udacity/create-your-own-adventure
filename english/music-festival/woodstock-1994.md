You're trapped in a memory of Woodstock '94.  Were these your experiences,
or do they belong to someone else... perhaps [many others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz227EU_1mU)?

You slide in the mud while being entertained by:
[Blind Melon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xph8pPJMB8)
[Primus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-HUK8qR9QA)
[Nine Inch Nails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lbFfiLAj_A)

Before your favorite band can play, you are
back in [the forest](../forest/forest.md) again.
