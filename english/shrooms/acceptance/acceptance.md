You understand that life is a matter of perspective and yours is flawed.

While everyone is chasing their careers and mortgages, quick marriages, fake 

politicians. You finally claimed peace for a moment. You understand that 

you are born out of the same stardust that created planets themselves.

Being happy and at peace you meditate about love and meaning of life.
