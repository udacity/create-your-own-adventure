You're feeling hungry anyway, so a little marshmellow can't hurt. You decide to eat through a good deal so you have plenty of energy.

Feeling enlightened, free, and tripping, the surge of the sugar rush hits as your thoughts begin to drift into the un-speakable.
You sit down and know somehow you won't be getting up for quite some time. As you trip, memories flash through and alternate universes race past.

You remember all is one organism and that all of life is in the same struggle chasing the same experience of truth, freedom, purity and compassion.
You realize all of these reactions are really the same experience merely being turned in different ways.

Your eyes close, and a blanket of hallucinated blue spores clouds over you like a blanket.
You awake in your dream. You are certain you have a mission here of some kind, and race to find it.

You meet Krishna. He informs you that outside is not actually the real world but that you're high in another dimension on another drug
and that what you currently feel is the 'real reality' is actually a giant trip. This is why you have no recollection of your birth.
This is why scientists in this dimension can't figure out quantum reality-- reality there is literally a giant paradox of many kinds and
there is no reality without subjective interpretation by an observer (who happens to be able to change physical particles with his mind and moods)
-- because the observer himself (you) is dreaming and is the only one that matters in this dream.

Do you:
[commit these realizations into memory, missing what Krishna says next] (../../../eating-marshmallows.md/steals_from_dreams.md)
[Continue listening to Krishna, just hope for the best about memory] (../../../eating-marshmallows.md/paying_attention.md)
[Challenge Krishna to a lucid dream flying sword duel. If you win, you recieve one free boon. If you lose, you die but experience nirvana.] (../../../eating-marshmallows.md/galactic_sword_duel.md)
