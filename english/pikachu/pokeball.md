Suddenly one marshmallow turns into pikachu!

And another turns into a pokeball!

You decide to try to catch pikachu by throwing ball at it.

Pikachu is trapped in ball but only lasts 2 seconds in it and pops out!!

Pikachu is now angry and throws ball at you and apparently you are now trapped inside!!

Its so dark and hot in the ball and you realize this is the end!

But wait! this has to be a dream right?

I cant be in a pokeball.

They dont exist!!

Its time to get up!

I must resolve this marshmallow dream.... i'm sweating!!
I must get revenge from pikachu as well but maybe later....
I am going to continue this battle in the real world, buying a gameboy!
