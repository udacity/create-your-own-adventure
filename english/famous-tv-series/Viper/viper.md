From Wikipedia:
Viper is an American action-adventure TV series 
about a special task force set up by the federal government 
to fight crime in the fictional city of Metro City, California 
that is perpetually under siege from one crime wave after another.

In reality, it's a terrible show about a sports car
that can transform into a slightly cooler sports car.
