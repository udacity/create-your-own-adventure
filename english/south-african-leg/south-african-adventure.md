A truly magnificent country - well worth a visit. 

South African culture offers so much! & our [award winning]( http://www.capetown.travel/trade-media/tm-news/cape-town-accolades/cape-town-accolades-and-awards) ‘Mother City’, [Cape Town]( http://www.capetown.travel/), is particularly popular! 

For your safari (or as the locals say "let's go to the bush") I offer a few options, both con and uncon-ventional:
1) The [Wildlife](http://www.capetown.travel/visitors/see-do/nature-adventure/wildlife/safari-experiences-near-cape-town) safari
2) The [Wine](http://www.capetown.travel/visitors/eat-drink/wineries/stellenbosch/wine-safaris-and-amazing-views-with-jordan-wine-estate) safari
3) The [Shark](http://www.capetown.travel/visitors/see-do/nature-adventure/ocean/shark-cage-diving-in-cape-town) safari

Or my personal favourite:

4) The [Rhino](http://www.capetown.travel/products/rhino-africa-safaris) safari
