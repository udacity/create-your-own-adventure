THUD...  THUD...  THUD...

Whatever, or whomever it is, they are certainly insistent.  You hold your head high, sniffing... Chocolate.  Or is it
fudge?  You pat your pockets, in search of...

And then you see it.  A door.  Not the quaint six panel door of a cottage, nor the ornate door of a mansion, not even
the plain door of a lavatory in a low-rent flat on the East side, it is just a door.  You try to describe it
mentally, try to keep the image in your mind to give it words, to give it shape, to give it substance, but you can't.
It is just a door, without shape or size or... Well, without anything.  It just is, and you know that it is without
being able to qualify it in the least.

THUD...  THUD... THUD...

You jump, not realizing your ear was pressed against it.  It felt like... It felt like...  It felt like moonlight.
It felt like rain.  It felt like the smell of a fresh-cut lawn.  It felt like forever.  It felt like just a moment ago.
It felt like...  It felt like...  It felt like nothing, and something, and everything.

You know this thing!  You have seen this thing!  When was it?  What was it?  What was it?!  Oh yes... It was...

THUD... THUD... THUD...
