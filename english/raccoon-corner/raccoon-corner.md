No one knew where the raccoon came from, only that he had the strangest, toothy grin.

Then I noticed why...the raccoon was holding a hot steaming cup of the most delicious
coffee known to man --- Colectivo Black Honey! It was obvious that he hadn't sipped
it yet though, so I had to decide whether to turn and [walk out of the room](walk-out/walk-out.md), 
or run over and [take that coffee from him](take-it/take-it.md)!
