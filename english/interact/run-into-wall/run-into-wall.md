You decide that you know marshmallows are soft.  How could they be solid walls? What
would happen if you just tried to run through them?  It probably wouldn't hurt to run
into a wall of marshmallows right?

You take a few steps back, take a deep breath, and start running right at the wall.
As the giant marshmallows rapidly get closer and your steps are pounding on the floor,
you are five steps away, four, three, two.... One step away from the wall you jump into
he air going full speed, lower your shoulder, duck your head, close your eyes, and feel
the squishy soft marshmallows all around your your body and then suddenly
you just feel air - you're through the wall!

You open your eyes and see....
