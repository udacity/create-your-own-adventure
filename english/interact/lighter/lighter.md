You take out your lighter and start roasting the walls.

Once you've roasted enough marshmallows to make out a door shape,

You take your fork out and eat those roasted marshmallows.

Now you have a door shaped hole in the wall.

You step out and see you are in a field with trees and birds.

The sun is shining so bright and it seems to keep getting brighter.

The whole scene fades and you wake up in your own bed.

The alarm is blaring and it shows its time to get ready for work.

You look around and realize it was just a dream!

It must've been because of those smores you wanted to eat last night but skipped!
