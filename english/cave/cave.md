You follow the strange noise over the hill and come upon a dark cave. 
Nervously, you approach the entrance and the sound gets louder, a 
crinkly, somehow wet shuffling noise. You come to the side of the entrance
and poke your head in, when a voice speaks:

"COME JOIN US"

and it pulls you into the darkness.
