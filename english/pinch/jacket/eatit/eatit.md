You eat a hole through the Marshmallow wall. Looking through the hole you see a hallway.

With a running start, you do a flip into a commando dive through the hole you just ate out.

After brushing the dust off your uncomfortable jacket you look around. 
Your commando dive caused a red hallway rug to get kinda messed up and pushed aside. 
The hallway before you is long and dimly lit, but in a warm and romantic way. 
The walls and floors are made of old dark oak wood, and a vague old smokey smell fills your lungs. 
Lining the walls down the hallway are an alternating cascade of doors and beautiful oil paintings.
