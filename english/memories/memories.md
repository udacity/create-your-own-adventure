What are memories?

Where do they come from?

Why can I only remember the past and not the future?

Why do my memories seem so inconsistent?
And why are they so fuzzy and unclear sometimes?

The first thing I remember is the cold tile floor. 

The last thing I remember is the dark moment as my eyelids fell as sleep came over me. 

Then went the [alarm](ground-hog/wakeup.md).
