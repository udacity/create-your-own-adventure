You look up to see nine imposing justices looking you dead in the eyes.

You know what you're here for: you're arguing before the Supreme Court to get out

[Say "Mr. Chief Justice. May it please the Court."] (argue/argue.md)

[Address Justice Antonin Scalia directly](scalia/scalia.md)

[Stare directly into Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's eyeballs](ginsburg/ginsburg.md)

[Punch opposing counsel in the face](opposing-counsel/punch.md)
