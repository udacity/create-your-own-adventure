You sink to the bottom like a rock and your vison is obscured by millions of
bubbles. When the bubbles finally clear, you see...

Nothing but darkness...

A light, but not the heavenly light, a light shining so bright that you find yourself [drawn to it](../heavenly_light/heavenly_light.md) 

What appears to be a ships anchor that leads all the way down to the [bottom of the ocean](..death/death_by_bubbles.md} and all the way to the [waters surface](../ships-ahoy/ships-ahoy.md)
