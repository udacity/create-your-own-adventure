Here are the famous quotes of Steve Jobs - Cofounder of Apple

1. I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you 	should go do something else wonderful, 
not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.

2. The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.

3. Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.


4. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know what you truly want to become.


5. My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.
