The Chief Marshmallow doesn't have the patience to deal with the likes of you.
He(it?) pulls a lever and the floor opens up beneath you and you disappear
inside.

You come out the other end, falling on top of some kind of car. Unscathed, you
look around noticing that the car is pretty wild. The driver leans out the
window and politely inquires about your name. You tell him. He tells you that
his name is Jeremiah Bones. After some pleasantries he asks if you wouldn't mind
getting off of his car.
