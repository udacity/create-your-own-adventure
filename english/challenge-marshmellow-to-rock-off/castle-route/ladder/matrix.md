You climb up the ladder, and reach what looks like a manhole cover at the top.
You move the cover away, and climb out onto the street...if you can call it
that.  This street is littered with scrap metal and broken circuitry, and there
is still barely any light.  You begin to wander aimlessly, but grab onto your
sword hilt whenever a sudden noise scares you.  You begin to feel very alone...

Suddenly, a voice behind you rumbles, "I see you've made it through the Rabbit
Hole."

You turn around, and are floored when you see Morpheus standing there!

As the Nebuchadnezzar pulls up, he says to you, "Would you like to join us?"
