Me: hello computerman, what wares do you have for me?

Suddenly, a polar bear walks into the room. You choose to either:

1) [Grab a shotgun sitting on the table in front of you](shotgun/shotgun.md) 
2) [Talk to the bear](bear-story/bear-story.md)

Meanwhile, the Computer-Man ignores the polar bear, and goes on blabbing...

Computer-Man: What about that shiny one that caught your eye in the window?
