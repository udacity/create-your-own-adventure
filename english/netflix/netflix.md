Switch on your laptop, go to netflix before you realize there's no available

networks in the marshmallow.

What do you do?

Especially since house of cards season 3 just became available. 

You search for the tech support number.

No answer, so you swith to HBO 

But, since it was Lent I decided to

Watch the Passion of the Christ instead

Until you realised you hate Mel Gibson

So instead watch Breaking Bad for the 12th time.
