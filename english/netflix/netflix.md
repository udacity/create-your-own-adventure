Switch on your laptop, go to netflix before you realize there's no available

networks in the marshmallow.

What do you do?

Especially since house of cards season 3 just became available.

You search for the tech support number.

No answer, so you switch to HBO

But, since it was Lent I decided to

Watch the Passion of the Christ instead

Until you realised you hate Mel Gibson

So instead watch [Breaking Bad](../breaking-bad/breaking-bad.md) for the 12th time.

Couldn't finish it, where are the new movies, netflix?!
