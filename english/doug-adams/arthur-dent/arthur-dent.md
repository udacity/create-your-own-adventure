You find yourself, still dressed in pajamas and robe, lying in the dirt in
front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying your house.

This must be Thursday. You never could get the hang of Thursdays.

You friend Ford appears.

"C'mon. Let's go to the [Pub](../ford-prefect/ford-prefect.md). He said they
won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers." Ford says.

Simply motion to the [bulldozer](../../marshmallow.md).
