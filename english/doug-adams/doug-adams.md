Where did all the dolphins go?

Dolphins are smart creatures, that much we know. 
However, it had never dawned upon us just 
how smart they actually were. 

The farewell message that they had sent 
prior to their departure was both enigmatic 
and ridiculous at the same time. 

So long and thanks for all the fish? 

Who would have thought... Who would have known?

There are two people left in this stupendous
galaxy who might know...
