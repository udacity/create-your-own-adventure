You close your eyes and put your fate into the wind's hands.  You're excited to see where it will take you.

You pass below the clouds and the earth below you is suddenly visible.  Or it would be, if your eyes were open.

Unfortunately, with your eyes closed you fail to see that you're rapidly approaching the ground.

Your last thought is, "I can't wait until I land."

Putting your fate in the hands of destiny may have led to trouble and misfortune in the past, but not this time!

With your eyes still closed, you land on something spongy and fluffy, taking away the consequences of the unforgiving force of gravity.

As your eyes open, you notice you've landed on the back of a giant sea bird who's coasting effortlessly along invisible currents of air.

[You decide that fate would rather you continue on your journey, you ride the bird until it lands.](/not-content/not-content.md)
