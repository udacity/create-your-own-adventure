You spend a moment viewing all the details of this marshmallow prison 

with complete clarity.  You discard the straight jacket simply by willing it. 

Then decide, the best way to handle the situation is to 

[eat your way out of it](../eating-walls/eating-marshmallows.md). 


But then you remember that this is a lucid dream.  You can do whatever you want. 

So, instead you decide to 

[fly](../fly/fly.md) 

until just before deciding to go to 

[nepal](../nepal/nepal.md).
