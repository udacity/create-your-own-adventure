You awake in a damp, medieval prison. A guard stands in front of your cell, facing away from you.

It is cold and you start to think that everything is lost, when you realise
that there is subtle but still bright reflection comming from the corner of
the cell.
Hoping for the guard to carry on facing away from you, you sneak up towards
the strange reflection to find out the light looks to be emited by a [strange object](../magic-device/magic-device.md)
different from anything you had seen before.
