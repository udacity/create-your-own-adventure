You awake in a damp medieval prison. The guard notices you wake up and laughs. "Not much longer until your turn on the gallows." he says. You stand and look around. The guards keys hang just in reach outside your cell. The bars of the cell window are rotting and corroded. A small, polished stone juts out of the nearby wall.

Do you:

Distract the guard and grab his [keys](keys/keys.md)

Grasp at the window bars and [pull with all your might](window/pull.md)

Push the small, polished [stone](stone/stone.md)
