After finally succumbing to the fact that Blizzard do indeed make the best computer games, you sit down at your NVidia-powered 32GB 3000MHz beast of a rig, and blitz out practice, before heading into Competitive mode.

After completing your placements, and landing in low bronze, you check [master-overwatch](https://masteroverwatch.com/) only to discover that you are indeed in the bottom 3% of players globally. You thus decide it is time to leave this earth in shame, and start to consider your options for [suicide](../commit-suicide/suicide.md).

Good luck
