The sound of the voice
Which is more ancient than my existence
Is the source of my heavenly joys


It sparks in me an unsual ecstasy
It overwhelms me
It brings back memories for my eyes to see

The heart which was happy for me
And the eyes which spilled over
As I won't be seen in their periphery
The sound of that silent breath's murmur
Echoes in my heart
And once again I remember everything from the start
The home which is nine months older to me than this world
The first ever human dairy around which my words swirled
The human which created me from nothingness
The human responsible for my existence

My friend, my first ever soul mate to you I am attached
with an invisible tether
I miss you, My mother.
