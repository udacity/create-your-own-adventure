She's sweet and pretty and smart, but she used to chew like Jabba-the-hut. I couldn't tell her this because I loved her. I really wanted to end the relationship, but I couldn't tell her why. Then one day, we were watching a Star Wars marathon when Jabba-the-hut came on and started flapping his gums and smacking his lips and devouring everything. It was disgusting... 

She looked at me and said, "You think I sound like that, when I eat, don't you?!"

"What?! NO! --I think it's cute!" I replied.

Suddenly, our Star Wars marathon ended.

She was out of my life for good and I was finally free.
