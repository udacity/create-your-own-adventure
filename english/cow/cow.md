As you walk towards the cow, reality itself seems to bend. The cow starts to look like a Picasso piece and its patches are glowing different colours.

Suddenly you have the overwhelming urge to [lick the purple patch](purple-patch/trip.md)

But there is a quiet voice in the back of your mind that tells you that [shaking yourself back to reality](../your-dog/your-dog.md) might just be better than going on this weird trip.
