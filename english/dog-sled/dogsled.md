You embark on a dog sled adventure across the globe, setting the record for the fastest time. Then you realize you're
[right back where you started](../marshmallow.md).

Unbeknownst to you, but amply apparent to your dogs, your acute case of snowblindness had caused you
to go far off course. On the way out of town on your record-setting trip you hit your head on a
low branch. With you unconscious, the sled dogs took the opportunity to eat a weeks worth of
rations. Lethargic with their bulging bellies, the dogs pulled you back to town so that they could
sleep in their cosy dog houses.

You slowly clue in to your prediciment when you can't explain why you're still wearing the same pair
of underwear you left with. What will you tell the local villagers who so graciously supported your
adventure?

[Move to Canada](../Canada/Canada.md)?

Leave town and play [Pokemon Go](../pokemon-go/pokemon-go.md) full time?
