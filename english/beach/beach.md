Managed to get lost in a scary forest-y beach at 3AM in the night. Trying to find my group I was wandering around
and suddenly I found a creepy house. The house itself was not too creepy, however, the lack of light and the old skinny woman staring out of the window holding a candle
made me run away and never look back. Till this day I'm not 100% sure if this actually happened or my young imagination
were so wild that was creating images...
