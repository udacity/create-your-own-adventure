You decide it'd be better to remain within the windshadow of the
pillar than risk being swept away into the darkness.  While you
are initially pleased with your decision, above the din of the
rushing winds you begin to hear a sound akin to hail hitting
a windshield.  The sound intensifies, and you feel the ground
beneath you beginning to shudder. All of the sudden, chunks
of your precious pillar are beginning to be ripped away to your
left and right, gradually reducing the amount of surface area 
of the only barrier between you and the chaos around you. This
doesn't look good.
