You cautiously extend your foot outward from the edge of the 
pillar, uncertain what to expect. In a flash, you are swept off
your feet and into the air, feet first. As you reach the speed
of the air around you, everything goes quiet, however you are
sure that you must be traveling at a tremendous velocity. After
what must have been hours pass, you begin to wonder if
this will ever end.  Just as that thought crosses your mind,
you notice a faint glimmering light in the distance.  Over the
next few minutes, the light grows gradually brighter.  Is it 
falling toward you, or you are falling toward it?  Either way,
it's time to assess if the light is a boon or a threat.
