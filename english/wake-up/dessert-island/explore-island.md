You decide that this is a lovely dream, so you decide to eat a marshmallow from
the campfire and explore the imaginary island.

As you start walking around, you realize that the ground is actually made of
marshmallows! The palm trees are made of licorice. The ocean tastes like 7-up.
Everything is made of candy and sugary sweet desserts!

You're not sure, but the moon might be cheese.

You walk along the beach until you come back to the campfire. The island is
smaller than you thought. You decide to climb the chocolate lave cake mountain
in the middle of the island to get a better view.

At the peak, you find out it's not an island at all! It's actually a sleeping
giant made of marshmallows. Is this the marshmallow chief?
