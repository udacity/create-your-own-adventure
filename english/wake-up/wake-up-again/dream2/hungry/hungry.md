The marshmallow chief starts his safety demonstration, as you amble closer.
Your instincts start taking over, hunger raging, and you move faster and faster.
The chief meets your eyes with a quizzical expression, 
and motions that you're "Quite close enough" to see his demonstration.
Delicious-looking beads of marshamallow sweat start to appear on his brow, and you're on him in a flash. 
He screams, and two security marshmallows run out from behind a large curtain, screaming and weilding large sticks.
You sink your teeth into the chief's scalp, and realize, to your horror, that they too are made from marshmallow.
They do no damage whatsoever.
Security is almost upon you. It isn't looking good.
What now?
