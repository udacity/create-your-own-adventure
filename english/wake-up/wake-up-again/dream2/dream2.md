You look up and see beautiful blue sky. It is a bright sunny day. 
You look around and you see big white cyclinders everywhere on all four sides. 
Suddenly an aircraft flies by. 
In the shiny underbelly of the airplane you see a sea of white cyclinders stretched across the landscape. 
You realize that you are just a marshmallow among thousands in a vast island of marshmallows.
Another marshmallow takes you to the marshmallow chief, who explains to you that
the dangers of sticks.
