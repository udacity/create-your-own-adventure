The marshmallow chief starts his safety demonstration. 
Two other marshmallows enter with props from behind a large curtain, 
bringing a large, pointed branch, and a wooden model of a fire. 
They proceed to act out what happens in the event of a 'sticking', 
gesticulating wildy about singed bottoms and the surprisngly delicious smell of burnt marshmallow skin. 
You chuckle to yourself. It's quite entertaining and all a little bit silly. 
You clap as they finish and bow, and look out to the horizon and contemplate the immediate future.
What now?
