You finally realize you're in a dream and can do ANYTHING you want!

You begin to imagine all the things you'd like to do.

But, alas, you wake up only to find yourself...

by a camp fire (with the smell of burnt marshmallow in the air)

on a deserted island

surrounded by dragons

Now you wonder how you got to this island. What were you doing

before you were on the island and where did the marshmallows come

from? Since you cannot remember any of these things then it begins

to dawn on you that you really are still having a dream.
