He begins scanning the network. But he can't find anyone!
His core temp starts to rise as his panic and extra clock cycles start to take effect.

*ping* Suddenly he finds someone! Its 192.168.100.-1!
How is this possible!
His clock cycles max out tyring to comprehend the situation.
"Whats happened to the network!? Who is -1?" 

Suddenly a Raspberry stumbles in with a Pi on his ARM. 
Raspberry yawns and blinks tiredly at 192.168.100.1. 
"Thanks for the 2's compliment but broadcasting around here is considered impolite
.....and you woke me to boot which I am less than grateful for".

192.168.100.1 blushed and felt another core panic coming on. He didnt know where to look.

"You might well look away. Imagine what I thought when I woke to hear the 
pitter patter of ICMP from the first address in my very respectable /24 
subnet......could it be.....surely not.......a default router?" Rasberry 
said in an irritated tone. 
"Of course it wasn't. It was you, just another home assistance gadget 
configured as if he's the only RFC1918 address in the IoT"
