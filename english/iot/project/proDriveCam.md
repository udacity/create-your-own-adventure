So you showed your interest in IOT.

I asssume you know what is IOT. Here I will be discussing one project of
IOT. The project name is PRO DRIVE CAM.

Yes!! It will be camera, but not like ordinary camera. This camera can be used

the video.

Confused ??????

And storage can be a some thing like google drive.
