Internet of Things(IoT) is a network of synchronised physical 'things' - gadgets,
automobiles, buildings - embedded with sensors and powerful electronic circuits
powered by intelligent code that enable them to talk to each other without human
interference.

The story begins here ...

The Internet of Things(IoT) is a new digital world that has a varied population.
It habours a few billion species of gigantic vehicles, microscopic chips, robots,
a dozen of concrete jungles(buildings) and anything you name...

One fine morning, 192.168.100.1, a drowsy young home assistance gadget wakes up
from a deep 'sleep' mode and preps himself up for the day - start network services,
initialise sensor inputs and load algorithms into memory. He makes a call to his
close friend 192.168.100.2, a gorgeous counterpart.

The lines are dead. He makes a dozen of vain attempts to a few other numbers.
Hours rolled by and the plight didn't seem to change. Terror soon took over him.

What will he do?

Yes that is one of the option what if he can sense the devices. One way of doing it can be using NFC!
