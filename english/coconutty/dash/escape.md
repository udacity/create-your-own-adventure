You aim for the metal hooks that bind the brush together. You hold your breath and concentrate on the angle and muster up all the strength left in your arm. You bring your arm back behind your head and SWOOSH, you throw it with all your strength.

The lighter flies 6 feet over the brush. Your jaw drops open. "I missed my only chance," you despair. The brush turns around to see the lighter hitting the tree trunk behind the clearing, and starts to laugh uncontrollably at your incredibly awful aim.

But that is all the distraction you need. You quickly scramble to your feet and leap away.

You survived another encounter with the Coconutty Brush. But it will be back, and next time, you better be prepared.
