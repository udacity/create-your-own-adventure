You decide it would be pointless to sneak into the 
demons room. Instead you raise your shield, and kick in
the door.

The demon is startled, and attacks, but runs into your shield.

You put your weight into your shield, and push the demon
back, for a split second, the demon seems startled.

Taking advantage of this, you crush the demons head
with a powerful swing of your mace.

The demon goes limp, its host body no longer able to sustain it.

A gust of wind rushes past you, accompanied by a frustrated, demonic wail.

Perhaps one day, you shall escape this dungeon.
But this story ends for now.
