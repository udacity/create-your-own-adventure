You find a cozy place near the torch to help keep you warm. You quickly drift into a deep slumber.

It is a shame you will never wake, for while you slept,
the demon got too hungry, and decided to club you,
while you slept helplessly.

Well, at least the demons hunger was sated....

Muwahahahhaahhaha!!!!!

Game Over!!!!!!
