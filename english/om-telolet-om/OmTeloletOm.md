"Om Telolet Om"

A phenomenal phrase that attacks almost any part of the world few days ago.

What is it actually?

It is originated from Indonesia. Kids on the street gathered up waiting for a bus passing by and scream up "Om Telolet Om".
They want a unique sound that specially installed in such vehicle to be used as horn. 
But that sound is...
so so fun and heart touching. You never can't forget it.

It is considered to be a great achievement when they finally get to hear it after asking it from ridiculously stingy bus driver.

Want to hear it NOW?
