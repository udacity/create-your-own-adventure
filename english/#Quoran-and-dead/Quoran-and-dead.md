So young Rahmeen wrote profusely on quora.
She wrote her heart out, but Lady Fortune never gave her upvotes. She grew increasingly sad which later bodered onto infuriation.
One dark night she ranted, "Those that don't visit my profile and appreciate my answers must die", and sobbed into her pillow to sleep. She wakes up to read the newspaper headlines, "A million sudden deaths, all were Quorans. QUORAN AND DEAD"

P.S:By the way, this is her profile [here](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rahmeen-Habib)
