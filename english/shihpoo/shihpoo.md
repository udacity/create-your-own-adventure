#Shihpoo

When you find the poodle, you remove the dumb hat and put your hand
out. The grey haired dog is actually a shih tzu poodle mix.  His 
hair is long and straight, just like a shih tzu.

He responds to you putting your hand out by resting his snout on it.
You look at him and he returns your gaze, and you see that he has the
most beautiful brown eyes. You pick him up and he rests his head on
your chest.

You raise him to look at his face again and he lets out a little 
whimper telling you that he likes you.  At that momemnt you knew
that this is the dog you wanted all along.
