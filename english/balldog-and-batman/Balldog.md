You cast your eye across the vast serene panorama of the awakening cityscape. Sunbeams begin to appear, pierceing through damp grey globules and their shadows. Columns of gold cluster and burn patches of blackened concrete and shimmer off glass spires. 

You think to yourself: 'This muthafricken OJ tastes hella good!! It's freshly pressed, It's got bare mad juicy bits.. Fack those smooth juice fools.' 

Feeling refreshed, energised and zingy you decide to take a walk in Gotham's famous Peripheral Park.

A gentle breeze carries ochre leaves dancing across the path. The canopy is burnt orange and gently glowing reds. 

A frenetic rustling to the left. 'On Guard!' Your mind shouts to yourself. 

'Mate, chill, it's just a giant baseball.. you scaredycat. Cat? Catwoman? What no I'm neither of those I had a morning glory this morning and... stop daydreaming man!'

Well, normally a giant baseball wouldn't seem too untoward except this one ain't no Phoney Island cheap fairground prize... 

'It's got legs! Little furry white legs with black socks! A pug's face, doughy self pitying eyes and a curly pig's tail!  Awwww. Wait but... DAFUQ!? This can't be real! It's got red stitching and the things perfectly cylindrical. So confuzed.' 

The balldog speaks:

'WAYNE! where the hell what the hell? We were just finishing up with those bozos and you frikkin all up and dissapear on me!? I'm not Robin ya'know you mini-horned gimp! From now on it's my way or the frikkinnnn highway.' 


Was there something funky in those juicy bits? Am I [still dreaming?!](../dream/dream.md)

Or... am I actually, truly, Batball's sidekick. Am I [Batman??!](../"I'm-batman"/batman.md)
