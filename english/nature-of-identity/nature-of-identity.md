You stumble upon an ancient [realisation](https://youtu.be/kVAHXiKjgRo).

If your physical form, the atoms that constitute your body, your thoughts and feelings,
and even your memories and DNA are ceaselessly changing, what is the constant property
that makes you... you?

Looking deeply inward you realise that it is consciousness, part ineffable and part sublime, that stands at the core of the transitory of nature of your being. As you look outward, you understand that before you looms the dragon of chaos ready to swallow you and your culture whole, ready to break the chain of existence that has lasted since life began on this planet.
