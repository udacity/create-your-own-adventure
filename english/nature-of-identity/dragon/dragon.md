With one foot firmly planted in the established order of your culture and another in the chasm of the unknown that stands before you, you take on the role of the metahero as you face the great Dragon of chaos head on. As you struggle and fight, you are filled with steel determination and a vision of a positively transformative future, and in a last ditch attempt you finally slay the dragon. Thus, you create new order for being to exist in as you revivify yourself and your culture and pass this sacred mission onto those who will come after you.
