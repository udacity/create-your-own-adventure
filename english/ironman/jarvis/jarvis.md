Just A Rather Very Intelligent System, or J.A.R.V.I.S. 
It is Tony Stark's artificially intelligent  computer. 
It is programmed to speak with a male voice in a British accent. 
J.A.R.V.I.S. is now merged with Vision [Source](http://marvel-movies.wikia.com/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.).
Vision held mind stone on his forehead during his creation in [Age of Ultron](https://goo.gl/4BjXvj) which was then <[SPOILER ALERT](https://goo.gl/xAGf3V)> (well, interesting things happened).
