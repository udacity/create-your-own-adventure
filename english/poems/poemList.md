This is a list of poems, and quotes to get you through some rough times.. Some are in afrikaans, some in english.

Something I [created](afrikaans/gedigte/gedigte.md) myself, my inspiration was one of my friends, whose mom died in a tragic car accident, I still remember the day so well, we met on a site called MXit, big social craze in South Africa back in the day (early 2000's), I sent it to her as comfort.

Something that really got me, was the poem `The Tiger` from William Blake, First time I heard it, was actually in the movie [Interstellar](english/poems/movie/interstellar.md)

Not really much to contribute, back to work for me :) Thanks for the great training!
