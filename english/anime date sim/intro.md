You live in the outskirts of a city. On your way from art classes that you attend at the local university, you make a detour to your secret place. It's a little hill that overlooks ruins of an old village.

As you're enjoying the view, you hear a voice of a camera shutter. You look back and see a dark haired girl with a camera concealing her face. She doesn't seem to notice you.
