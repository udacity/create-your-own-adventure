''Not everyone can hear the silent language between a horse and a rider.
Not everyone can trust their life with a 1200 lb animal.
And not everyone has the guts, blood, sweat, tears and dedication needed to be part of this world.

But equestrians are no ordinary people and horses are no ordinary animals.
The only ones who truly understand this world are the ones who are part of it.''
