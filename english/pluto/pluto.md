You wake up, settled in a captain's chair.
You are surrounded by various buttons, terminals, and feeds.
Outside of the cockpit, you see nothing but the vast expanses of space.
Millions of stars, galaxies, planets, etc. with the possibility of life.

These buttons and controls seem foreign to you, but a post-it note
lies on the console, attached to a rearview monitor.

What do you do?
