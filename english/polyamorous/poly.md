You read up on polyamory and find that communication is a key
ingredient in a functioning poly relationship.
"Perfect!", you think. "I love talking about my feelings and
listening to others'!"
But you are also kind of a jealous person - how is that supposed
to work out?
"Don't worry", you read on the website you're at, "almost every-
one feels jealousy - it's just a matter of how you react to it.
Instead of feeling that your partner/s did something wrong, or
that you need to control them, or that you are a bad person, 
see the jealousy as a sign of some insecurity that you have and
that now when you discovered it, you have a chance to fix it!"
"Yeah, I can do that!", you think, and start your poly adventure
with lots of love, self-improvement and, naturally, communication.
