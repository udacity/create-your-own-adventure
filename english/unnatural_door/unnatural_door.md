You arrive in a room too small to contain everything inside.
Scattered throughout are empty cubes made of only obtuse angles, and obsidian pillars that loop back on to themselves.
The sight of the impossible geometries within begins to warp your mind.
[Escape](../marshmallow.md) back through the door, or remain inside, mad for eternity.

The sane person would hightail it outta there...but what if you're a gunslinger?
A gunslinger waiting for another door to appear in amongst the mad cubes and pillars?
A door to the Western Seas...and those terrible, snapping Lobstrosities?
