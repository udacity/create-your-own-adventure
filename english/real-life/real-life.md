  So, if this is real-life, then you are either considering doing UDACITY's
   course ["How to Use Git and GitHub"](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) or
   you are well on your way to completing it.

 Therefore, don't consider this a dead-end in the adventure story, but a step
  along the path toward better collaborative coding.
