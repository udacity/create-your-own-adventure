  So, if this is real-life, then you are either considering doing UDACITY's
   course ["How to Use Git and GitHub"](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) or
   you are well on your way to completing it.

 Therefore, don't consider this a dead-end in the adventure story, but a step
  along the path toward better collaborative coding.

Step. Step. Step. Step. Step... You open your eyes. Has it been days. No, maybe months. Years?
All you recall is the constant motion forward... Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step...

Where you stand feels familiar, but distantly [impossible](../impossible/impossible.md).
