Darkness. Fluffiness. 
Fluffiness. Darkness. 

You turn around and see the marshmallow from
which you emerged. As it struggles to take it's
last breath, you tap the powers of the One and 
Incept it's mind. Within, you see the plans of 
evil that the marshmallows plot, but just before
leaving, out of the corner of your mind's eye, you 
see their weakness. Fire. And not the fire of a 
backyard party, but pure, white fire - that which
only the One can achieve...

Wait a minute...what is this place.  Is that fire or 
just the sun?  And is this a marshmallow or the snow?
Such a tall wall.  I've never seen such a tall wall...
