You will realize that we have not taken a long walk from long time
and this is the right time for this

You put on your shoes and coat and open the door. Opening the door you see a butterfly flittering past as you step out into the open air.

Mmmm, butter... I'm hungry."

You decide to:

[Eat a sandwich](../../sandwich/sandwich.md)

[Taste the rainbow](../../eat-rainbows/rainbows.md)

[Grab a slice of 'za](../../coffee/chilli/pizza-with-chilli.md)
