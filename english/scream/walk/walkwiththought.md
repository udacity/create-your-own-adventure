You will realize that we have not taken a long walk from long time
and this is the right time for this

You put on your shoes and coat and open the door. Opening the door you see a
butterfly flittering past as you step out into the open air.

You think to yourself, "self, isn't it weird when one word is made of two other
unrelated words? Like butterfly... butter... fly.....
Mmmm, butter... I'm hungry."

You decide to:

[Eat a sandwich](../../sandwich/sandwich.md)

[Taste the rainbow](../../eat-rainbows/rainbows.md)

[Grab a slice of 'za](../../coffee/chilli/pizza-with-chilli.md)
