You realize that you have not taken a long walk from long time
and this is the right time for this. 

You put on your shoes and coat and open the door. Opening the door 
you see a mysterious man in a trenchcoat in a convertible parked in
front of your house. You don't know him, but you are sure that he's 
a spy, trying to find you for some unfinished business from your
past.
