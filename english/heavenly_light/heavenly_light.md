You head towards the light, unsure of what you might find, but something inside you is drawn to this light... it is warm on your face and no longer do you feel the pain of no longer being able to breath... you now feel like you can breath underwater as you pass under some kind of archway and find you are able to stand upright and place your feet on the ground...
