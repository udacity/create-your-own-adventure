You were always intrigued by endurance sports. 
So you head over to wikipedia and look up triathlon. 
It happens to be one of the most demanding endurance events in the world. 
The full distance entails 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and 26.2 mile run. 
You're hooked with the challenge. 
You click on the [IRONMAN](http://www.ironman.com) link on the wikipedia page.
There happens to be a race very close to you and you sign up.
What the? did I just do? 

It's only noon, and the race is 6 months away.  You must train.
After one hour perusing pictures of glorious triathlon victories, you realize
the true key to success is all in your tri-suit.
You head over to [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) to spend the rest of your day
reading reviews.

Okay, now you realize that this is going to cost you some real money.  You
have to get some serious gear to compete.  You can't just use an old bike 
and any pair of sneakers.  You need to put together a budget.
