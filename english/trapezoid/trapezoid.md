There is a blackboard and a chalk

You draw a perfect trapezoid on the blackboard

The finished trapezoid starts to glow and a hole appears

Mystified, you enter the trapezoid

This trapezoid world gives every traveler a square to dance on. 

The right type of dance will crack the square open. 
For example [Square dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_dance)

However, you could essentially be pick the wrong type 
of dance which in turn will land you
in a world with where people only spoke like Deepak Chopra 
where the mind is purely a consonant in the existence 
of all there is to be.
