You realise you need as much information as you need to get out of this situation.

And the only thing you can ask about this seems to be Marshmellow man. You decide to befriend him.

"Hello, Marshmellow man..er.. uh..Do you have a name?" , I asked, not really expecting any answer 
and wondering whether I have gone crazy to be talking with a marshmellow.

"My name is Marshy", mellowed a sweet sounding sing songy voice. "And I am a woman", it said.

I was a little embarrassed and surprised to hear back a reply. "Where am I?", I asked.

"Whoa..an alien planet? How did I end up here?", I asked with my heart rate begining to rise.

"Don't  be afraid", Marshy tried to calm me down. "This place is friendly. This planet is called UR58F3 and about 10 light years
away from Planet Earth. Your Earth started to literally disintegrate into pieces. So our leaders transported all the remaining 
humans here."

I was a little relieved. But my mind was beginning to swarm with all sorts of questions.

"So, how long have I been in hyper-sleep?", I enquired.

"About 10 months", Marshy replied. "you were one of the last group to be transported here. We always leave humans in sleep to 
assess their physical condition and to tune them up to suit to this Planet's environment. Oh I forgot. One month in our Planet is equal to 10 years in your Earth time. So 100 years have passed in Earth time"

I started to faint and couldn't hear more of what Marshy was saying.
