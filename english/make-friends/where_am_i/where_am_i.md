You realise you need as much information as you need to get out of this situation. 

And the only thing you can ask about this seems to be Marshmellow man. You decide to befriend him.

"Hello, Marshmellow man..er.. uh..Do you have a name?" , I asked, not really expecting any answer and wondering 

whether I have gone crazy to be talking with a marshmellow.

"My name is Marshy", mellowed a sweet sounding sing songy voice. "And I am a woman", it said. 

I was a little embarrassed and surprised to hear back a reply. "Where am I?", I asked. 

"This planet is called UR58F3 and about 10 light years away from Planet Earth. 

Your Earth started to literally disintegrate into pieces. So our leaders transported all the remaining humans here."

I was a little relieved. But my mind was beginning to swarm with all sorts of questions. "So, how long have I been in hyper-sleep?", I enquired.

"About 10 months", Marshy replied. "you were one of the last group to be transported here. 

We always leave humans in sleep to assess their physical condition and to tune them up to suit to this Planet's environment', she intoned.

I couldn't wait to go out and explore the new Planet. But I was feeling very tired and felt like didn't ahve any energy left.

"Oh I forgot. One month in our Planet is equal to 10 years in your Earth time. So 100 years have passed in Earth time"

So that made me 120 years old and realising that I started to faint and couldn't hear more of what Marshy was saying.
