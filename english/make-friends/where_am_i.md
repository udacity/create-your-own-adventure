You realise you need as much information as you need to get out of this situation.

And the only thing you can ask about this seems to be Marshmellow man. You decide to befriend him.

"Hello, Marshmellow man..er.. uh..Do you have a name?" , I asked, not really expecting any answer 
and wondering whether I have gone crazy to be talking with a marshmellow.

"My name is Marshy", mellowed a sweet sounding sing songy voice. "And I am a woman", it said.

I was a little embarrassed and surprised to hear back a reply. "Where am I?", I asked.

Marshy replied...
