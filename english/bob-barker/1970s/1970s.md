You open your eyes and see yourself reflected back in a mirror.  

You have on a bright blue shirt whose collar is about twice the size it should be.  

You look down and see that your jeans are bell bottoms fastened with an oversized buckle.

You mumble, "What in the world?"

It's at that moment you realize a man is standing directly next to you.  

He reminds you of a caricature of a caricature with crazy glasses.

"Andy Warhol?", you ask tentatively.

"I think it would be terrific if everybody was alike.", he replies.  "Fantasy love is much better than reality love. Everyone needs a fantasy."

In the distance you hear Dancing Queen playing...'you can dance, you can jive...'.  

'When in Rome' you think to yourself.

You hear a hushed voice state, "There can be only one."
