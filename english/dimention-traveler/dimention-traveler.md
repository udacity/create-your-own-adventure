The book is droped down your hand when you try to take it. Looks
like it chosed me you said in your mind. You read the chapter one 
then I you found this not a book but a key to fit the right one 
to control the time and space, and it's leave here by your descendant 
from 1000 years later. Now what you gonna do the next?
