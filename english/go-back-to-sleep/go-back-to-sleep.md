The marshmallow floor is soft, and thankfully not very sticky.

It's super weird that there is a marshmallow floor whether you're awake or you're dreaming. Maybe you're always
dreaming?

Before getting into the bed you decide to reach down and grab a piece of marshmallow floor.
It tastes really good, but you can't help but being disgusted by the thought of all the 
feet that have been on the floor.

You roll over, let your eyes close shut, and drift off into [dreamland](../dream/dream.md)

You wonder, idly, what happens if you start dreaming from within a dream..

When suddenly you are face to face with [Leonardo DiCaprio](./dream-ception/dream-ception.md)

You want to say something to him but you draw a blank.

The only movie you can think of that he was in is "Basketball Diaries".

So you just smile and keep going.

But suddenly, you're on a boat. A huge boat. A [doomed](./imflying/titanic.md) boat?
