"He's just such a cliché."

"Really?," Avon, your squire, stops and turns to look at you.
"Really? That's the reason you want to kill him? Because he's a cliché?"

You stop and stare back at Avon. "Well, come now Avon... the fire breathing, the treasure hoard, the mountain lair...
and on top of that, there's been barely a virgin to be had in these parts since he showed up."

Avon ponders for a moment.

"Ok, I'll give you that... a scarcity of virgins seems a 'much better' reason for a good knight such as yourself to
slay a dragon!"

"Are you mocking me Avon?" you ask, as you continue to climb the mountain path. "It's very fortunate for you that I'm
as fond of you as I am... and that this blasted armour isn't going to get itself off if I run you through with my sword.
Speaking of which, would you mind just holding onto it for a second while I climb up these rocks to get a look ahead?
Thanks so much. Anyway, as I was saying, the fundamental point is he's a dragon, and as such he has no right to exist.
I mean - what is this? The damned dark ages?"

"Well actually sir..."

"Yes Avon, what is it?"

"It is the dark ages sir..."

"You need not split hairs with me young Avon, I was slaying dragons long before you took your first... sh&ast;t!"

"Good point sir, if rather crudely put..."

"Sh&ast;t, sh&ast;t, sh&ast;t!"

"Sweet Lord," Avon mutters as he surmounts the rock outcrop and spots what you're looking at.

Perched atop the mountain ahead of you is the largest dragon either of you have ever set eyes upon. As if on cue, it
unfurls its wings, casting an appalling shadow across the mountainside. Imperiously it surveys its domain - its enormous
head swinging slowly from side to side as flames and smoke belch from nostrils the size of cannonballs.

"Well," you croak, trying to put a brave face on it, but being betrayed by your wavering voice, "this is erm....
interesting. How to proceed in the face of... face of... that! Any ideas Avon?"

"Well naturally sir, being the brave and accomplished knight you are, I know that your first inclination will, of
course, be to [charge the beast directly](charge-beast/charge.md).

"But let me stop you for a moment sir, if I may. A couple of other tactical choices do seem to present themselves. For
example, you might want to try... well... to [be friendly to him](be-friendly/friends.md)?

"No need to raise that eyebrow just yet sir, I'm still thinking.... ooh I know! Is it really necessary to actually kill
him sir? I mean wouldn't humiliating him work just as well? He's not spotted us yet, so what if you were to [sneak past
him](sneak-past/sneaky.md), steal a bit of treasure off his pile and make off back down the mountainside?

"Still not quite convinced? Well, erm... let me see. Now it might be my imagination playing tricks on me sir, but I
could have sworn you mentioned earlier that this little jaunt was more by way of a surveillance operation in preparation
for the big push. You recall saying that sir? Seems to me we've done our surveilling now and can beat a swift retrea...
re... trace... retracing of our steps, and [get back down the mountain](back-down/retreat.md) in time for a swift pint at the Oak and Druid.
Which is quite appropriate, since it's the only tavern around here that hasn't been reduced to a smoking ruin.

"So... what say you sir?"
