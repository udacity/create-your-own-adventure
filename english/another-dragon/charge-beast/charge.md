Snatching your sword back from your surprised squire, you shut your eyes tightly and run yelling and furiously swinging
your sword arm into a maelstrom of smoke and fire.

You come to as the face of your faithful squire peers over your reclined form.

"How... how...," you croak quietly, "how bad is it Avon?"

"Could be worse sir," Avon says, as nonchalently as he can manage.
"And you know, a lack of body hair is considered quite the rage in some parts these days... so I'm told."

"My God," you mutter "well at least the beast didn't eat me."

"Oh he gave it a good try sir, but the armour you see sir... I think it made you a little bit too crispy for his liking
sir. In fact the... erm... broken arm sir... that was when you hit the tree after he spat you out. Bit of good fortune
if you ask me."

"Well fortune favours the brave, as they say Avon. Now be a good fellow and help me to my feet so we can get off this
wretched mountain will you?"

"Erm... about that sir..."
