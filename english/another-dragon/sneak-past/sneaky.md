With trepidation, you begin to tiptoe around the side of the mountain - one eye on the dragon keeping watch from its
roost and the other on the gaping wound that marks the mouth of its cave. The cave where you will find the dragon's
treasure hoard.

As you get closer to the cave's entrance your confidence begins to grow. The stupid dragon's sleeping on the job and it
looks increasingly like you'll be getting away with daylight robbery.

All thoughts of the dragon leave your mind as you reach the cave and catch sight of the mounds of gold within.
Your breath catches in your throat as you dive headlong into the drift of coins and gemstones. Quickly you remove your
helm and begin to fill it with as much treasure as you can.

"Tut tut!" A booming voice from above you startles you into dropping the helmet. Looking up you are aghast to see the
dragon glaring down at you from the top of the treasure pile.
How can this be? The only entrance to the cave is behind you. He couldn't possibly have got past without you noticing.

"You know," the dragon says, seemingly unconcerned that you are slowly backing away as he speaks,
"I really am rather disappointed. Knight errant turned thief? For shame."

You have the decency to turn a little red as you back up ever more quickly towards the entrance.

"But I suppose I can't be too hard on you," the dragon continues magnaminously.
"After all, I have been practicing a little deception of my own."

At this you turn and run... straight into the claw of another huge dragon, now blocking your escape.

"I believe," says the first dragon as it slides down the treasure pile towards you,
that you've already met my brother..."
