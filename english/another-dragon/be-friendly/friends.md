"Ah," you say gleefully, as you saunter over to the dragon, leaving your sword with your squire,
"and here was I hoping I might sneak past while you were on a smoking break."

The dragon turns its head langourously to face you.

"Oh very droll," it says in a voice that sounds like heavy chains being dragged over rocks,
"very droll indeed. I do like a meal with a sense of humour."

"Ha ha," you respond quickly, tapping your armour, "I foil wrapped myself especially."

"You know you are quite the most entertaining barbecue I've ever had," the dragon says, resting its head on a rock.
"Keep this up and I might even let you live."

***

A couple of hours later, the two of you are are rolling around mirthfully as if you've been buddies for years.

"You know," the dragon says, the tip of its wing lightly resting on your shoulder, "I've had such a wonderful evening.
I really think we should round things off by enjoying a couple of virgins I've had put by. What do you say?"

"Honestly," you say with bon homie, "there really is no need..."

"Oh, but I insist" says the dragon.

"Well," you say with a leer as you begin desparately clawing at the straps on your armour,
"since you put it like that..."

"Oh one last thing," the dragon says as he turns back towards you, "would you like any relish on yours?"
