"As you say Avon," you mutter, hastily climbing back down the rocky outcrop, "this was just a
reconnaissance mission. And now we know the score, we can complete our planning, and erm...
well, do whatever we... err... plan."

"Sir..."

"Come along Avon, we want to be off this mountain before nightfall."

"Sir," Avon puffs, scrabbling down the rock behind you." If... (puff) I might...
(puff) suggest a first... (puff) item for the plan...?"

"Yes Avon?"

"Ruuuuuuuunnnnnn!"

At that point he jumps to the path and sprints as fast as he can towards the valley. As you speculate on what's caused
this uncharacteristically energetic behaviour, the path darkens ominously and your eye traces the unmistakable shadow
of a wing.

In less than 200 yards you have overtaken your luckless squire, a most remarkable feat given that you're the one
wearing armour.

"I think, Avon," you say breathlessly as the two of you reach the valley floor, "we've managed to lose him."

"Let's hope so sir," Avon replies nervously as he scans the treetops.

By the time the village comes in sight you are both confident that the dragon has given up the chase.

"And there," you say grandiosely, with a sweeping gesture towards the Oak and Druid,
"is our reward for a day's work, bravely done."

"Oh sir," Avon remarks, licking his lips, "I can't remember when I was so looking forward to a good pint of ale in
front of a roaring fire..."

Avon's jaw hangs loose as the Oak and Druid explodes in a shower of flame and rubble.

As the smoke clears it reveals the dragon, standing over the charred ruins.

"Gentlemen," it says, cheerfully, "I toast your health sirs... it's the very least I can do for your assistance in
helping me find the last tavern standing so I can complete the set..."
