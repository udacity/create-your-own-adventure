Against your better judgment, you continue to dig straight down.

You find a vein of iron ore and mine it.

After digging a little more, you find coal and mine it.

Things are going well, so you try to dig down for diamonds.

You did it! At height 9, you found diamonds! 

You dig straight down into your first diamond and land in lava.

The lava kills you.
