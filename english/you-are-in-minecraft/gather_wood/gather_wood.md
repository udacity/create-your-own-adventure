You look at the nearby forest and you see birch trees.
Your minecraft instinct kicks in and your mind says 'MUST COLLECT THEM'. 
You notice your food level going down and you realize you are in survival mode and you need to survive.

You begin to chop them down and you notice something strange.

You see an elephant.
