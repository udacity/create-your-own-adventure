Uh-oh, you feel a dull pain in an a upper molar
on the right side of your mouth. Shouldn't have eaten
all those marshmallows. It's better to eat fruits and vegetables. 
But who can resist for marchmallows?! 
So, dont worry. Continue eating marshmellows. If you loose all you teeth, you can replace them with the artificial ones.
Or get metal teeth like the Bond villian Jaws.

You could brush your teeth with baking soda and rinse
with baking soda to be able to enjoy your marshmallows
without having to visit the dentist!
