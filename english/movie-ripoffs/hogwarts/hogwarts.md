Your guts turn inside out as your apparation spell throws you violently halfway across the world.
You look around at the inside of the great hall at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  
It's just after dinner and the place is crowded with students.

A bearded Giant clumps up to you yelling "Cor blimey - it's HARRY POTTER!" as he picks you up in a violent bear hug.
"I think you're badly mistaken" you exclaim breathlessly as he places you back on the ground.

"No - no mistake, Harry.", he says gleefully as he quickly scribbles a zig-zag on your forehead with a 
permanent marker pen.  "You've got the scar and everything!".

Just then a clever looking girl approaches. 
"Hi, I'm Caroline Granger", she says, sticking out her hand.  "Don't mind Hagrid. He's severely delusional."
"Safest to just humor him." she whispers quietly.

"But where is Harry Potter?" you ask puzzled.

"Oh there's no such person." says Caroline smugly.  "George and Fred just invented him to freak out old Mouldy-Wart."

At that moment, a frazzled looking bald man comes rushing out of a side door shaking with anger and yelling...
"I'll get that Harry Potter if it's the last thing I do!".

A chorus of voices respond with helpful, but conflicting advice such as "Saw him in the girl's toilets, Sir", and  
"Killing death-eaters on the 3rd floor, Sir".  This advice is followed by poorly concealed snickering 
from other students as the elderly wizard leaps up the staircase in misguided pursuit.  

"Don't forget to put on your invisible cloak, Sir" calls Caroline as he disappears out of sight.  

"We just tell him that he's invisible when he's wearing it - he's soooo gullible." giggles Caroline, rolling her eyes.
