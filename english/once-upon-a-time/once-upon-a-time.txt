Once upon a time, there was a princess living in a castle.

One day, a dragon kidnapped her. He left a message saying that only the prince
from the neighbouring country can save her.

So the prince set out to save the princess.

When he reached the dragon's cave, he found the princess consoling a crying 
dragon.

'Tell me,' the prince said, 'are there any way I can stop you from kidnapping
her at least twice a week?'

The dragon looked up at him with teary eyes.

The prince arched an eyebrow. The princess scolded at him.

'Don't... Don't marry the princess,' the dragon whispered.

'Hmmmmmm... Father would not be very happy if I don't get married this year.'
the prince drawled, ignoring the princess's exasperated look, 'You'll have to
find me a new bride.'

Before the dragon could say anything, the princess pushed him towards the
prince.

'I'm done playing this kidnapping game with you two,' she rolled her eyes,
'Either you two put an end to it, or I'll have to charge you for this.'

The prince chuckled and turned to the still startled dragon in his arms. 'So
what do you say? Would you volunteer?'

'What... Oh...', the dragon blushed, his voice barely audible, 'Yes, I...
I volunteer.'

'Good,' the prince smirked and held the dragon tighter.

From then on, they lived happily ever after.

What about the princess? Well, she was happy to call off her engagement with
the prince and marry the knight she always loved.
