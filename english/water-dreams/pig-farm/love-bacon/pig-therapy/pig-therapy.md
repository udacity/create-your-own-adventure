You find a pig phonebook, and look for a nearby therapist.

You are lucky enough to someone nearby who takes your insurance!

Score!

You set up your first appointment with Dr. Oinkums, and attend.

She listens to you speak of your feelings of guilt, particularly

regarding your love for bacon, now that you are a pig.

She helps you feel a little bit better about yourself.
