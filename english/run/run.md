Going for a run allows for further self reflection and ensures body and mind are at one.  
You pass a storefront window, and reflect upon the handsome man or woman reflected back.  Their powerful 
stride drives them past the leaders in the Olympic marathon.  You turn your gaze forward, enter

"Why are my walls made of marshmallows?" you think to yourself.
You get up, to go to your dead-end job to pay for the mountain of student loans your acquired
while seeking that degree in Lego Engineering.
You realize Lego Engineering may not have been the best choice in majors...
