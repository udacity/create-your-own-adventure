Rules and game-play

Cricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each.
One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball,
attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.
The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent.
In some forms of cricket, it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match,
which would otherwise be drawn.

The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century.
Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national s
port in the 18th century and has developed globally in
the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played
since 1844 and Test cricket began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877.
Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after association
football[citation needed]. Governance is by the International
Cricket Council (ICC) which has over one hundred members although only ten play Test cricket.
