Rules and game-play

Cricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each. 
One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball, 
attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. 
The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent. 
In some forms of cricket, it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, 
which would otherwise be drawn.

There are three main forms of the game: Test cricket, One day Cricket and T20. These are listed in the decreasing order of the time spent by the players. Test cricket could last for 5 days, while one day format, by it's name lasts one day and T20 is a format where each team plays for 20 overs and shouldn't last more than 4 hours.
