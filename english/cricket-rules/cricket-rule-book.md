Rules and game-play

Cricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams of eleven players each. 
One team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other bowls and fields the ball, 
attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. 
The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent. 
In some forms of cricket, it may also be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the match, 
which would otherwise be drawn.

As for dismissing a Batsmen there are some different ways you can dismiss a batsmen: 
1. The first and the hardest is the bold out AKA(wicket out). you need to ball at a length in which your ball hits the stumps of the batsmen.
2.The second is the most common way to dismiss a batsmen it's called a (catch out). Whenever the batsmen hits the ball the fielders have to catch the ball without letting the ball touch the ground.
3. The third is also like um... also a common way to dismiss a batsmen. When a batsmen bats there is a specific line IN-WHICH the batsmen has to stand in. if you bowl and the batsmen misses the ball and the ball reaches the wicket-keeper and if the batsmen is NOT standing in the line and if the wicket-keeper hits the stumps. The batsmen is dismissed.
