You're out on your Tuesday walk. Just you and your thoughts.
"Left, right, left, right".
Enter grasshopper.
It jumps on your head. A fear engulfs you and you faint.
The grasshopper is in a car.
It's driving a car. No. It's a self driving car.
The hopper is now exiting the car.
Grass is all you see.
Into the [hallway](../hallway/hallway.md) for more thoughts.
