Fall is the time to enjoy nature's amazing color displays known as "fall foliage"!

Three great national parks for leaf peeping are 
the [Blue Ridge Parkway](http://www.nps.gov/blri/index.htm), [Acadia](http://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm), and [Yellowstone](https://www.yellowstone.org/experience/yellowstone-forever-institute/?gclid=CL3Hz_2Hs9ICFRBsGwodUvoNcQ).
