Winter can be a cold and bitter time. However, it is hard to find more 
beauty outdoors than the snow capped peaks of [Glacier National Park]
(http://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm)! Great adventure awaits there. You can
camp and hike. If you are adventurous, you can try some winter wilderness
treks in the [backcountry](http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/backcountry.htm).
Hope you have winter navigation skills!
