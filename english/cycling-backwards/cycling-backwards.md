It has long been rumoured that Polar Bears can cycle and moreover, cycle backwards. In reverse.
Unlike brown bears, who can only play balalaika, and only in Russia.

...but what about other animals that can cycle forwards.  [What do they do?](../cycling-forwards/cycling-forwards.md)

I sometimes pretty much think that only I can cycle in the forward direction. All the others ride in the backward directions. 
Is it me who has been doing it the wrong way the whole time or is it the whole world doing it the wrong way at the right time. 
It is quite an amazing thought that comes to me quite frequently and wastes my time. 
Time flies away like anything leaving me behind, sitting on the chair by the side of my window and me staring at the blue sky like a mother looking at its child at its birth.

I feel mesmerised and enlightened by view of polar bears cycling backwards and the brown bears playing balalaika. 
I then find myself between russian horses in Russia who more or the less look like me riding cycle in the forward direction. 

Is it the horses or me who look alike?
