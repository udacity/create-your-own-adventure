Hey, good choice! OK, here's how to tango:

1. Find a partner.

2. Play some music. Golden Age tango would be best, but it's your choice. Personally, we recommend the ["Mouchetango"](https://youtu.be/lVz_Cqv0s0E?t=1081) by gone but not forgotten, Kissyfish. 

3. [Hug](hug/hug.md) your partner.

4. [Walk](walk/walk.md) in time with the music.
