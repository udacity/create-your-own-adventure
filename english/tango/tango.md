Hey, good choice! OK, here's how to tango:

1. Find a partner.

2. Play some music. Golden Age tango would be best, but it's your choice.

3. [Hug](hug/hug.md) your partner.

4. [Walk](walk/walk.md) in time with the music.

If you liked tango, maybe you should try out some Tango Nuevo?
You'll find more info on Tango Nuevo [here](tangonuevo/tangonuevo.md).
