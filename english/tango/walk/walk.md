Walk. One foot in front of the other, preferably in time with the music.

You'll be walking forwards, your partner will be walking backwards.

Keep your eyes open and watch out for collisions.

The problem is your partner has two left feet:

1. He spins you into a tornado and you fly through the [roof](../english/roof-top/roof-top.md).

2. She steps on your [toe](toe/toe.md) with one of her Louboutins.
