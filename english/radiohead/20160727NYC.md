I was here in Madison Square Garden, NYC, Jul 27, 2016. Didn't get a face price ticket, so I paid a lot more for a second hand wheelchair seat that is pretty far away from the stage. However, I was very very lucky that night. Maybe it's because it's the last concert in NYC in this tour, they played Karma Police and even Creep! Can you imagine how crazy we were? 

Here's the song list on that night.
