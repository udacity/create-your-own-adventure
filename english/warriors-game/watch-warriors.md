You remember that today is game 1 of the 2015 NBA finals between the Golden State Warriors and
Cleveland Cavaliers. You ask yourself, "How can a big Warriors fan like myself forget such an 
important day in the  history of the franchise?

The Warriors last championship was won in 1975. You realize that that was before you were born.
You've suffered through 16 years of bad basketball. All the pain and agony of yesteryears have
turned to cries of  jubilation. All the cursing replaced with cries of joy.

You think back to when you first became a Warriors fan. "Ah yes" you say to yourself. "It was
1991. The 90's was such a great decade!" You start reminiscing about the 90's. You get
nostalgic and have fond memories of playing Oregon Trail in computer class at school. Oh the
good old days, when the deejay plays a Tevin Campbell track at your school dance, and you know
that no girl can resist a slow dance. You ponder about what else was great about the 90's.

Michael Jordan was pretty great. LeBron James is great too. But not that great. They would be 
great if they had not traded Wiggins. That was a dumb move. Warriors win in 5.

The Warriors won in 6. Lebron was great, but the Warriors prevailed!

And Dwyane Wade slept like a baby.

A baby that was thinking about the boom/bust nature of the NBA draft. Why did
anyone think Anthony Bennett was deserving of the number 1 pick? But you could
argue the Cavs were geniuses to pick him because one year later it netted
LeBron. So weird.
