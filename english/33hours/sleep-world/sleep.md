Your eyes feel heavy. You gently place your head back against the pillow.

The pain in your head begins to fade. The world becomes fuzzy, disjointed -
your thoughts are marked by a familiar but chaotic pattern of non-sensical
creativity as the world of dreams comes into focus.

You find yourself in a white labratory. There are two plastic stools, a
series of benches with a variety of metal scientific apparatuses. There
are also sheets of graph paper smeared with globs of thick black ink - 
you can't decipher most of the writing or diagrams, but you do see two 
words outlined by a large box on the centre of one sheet. The words 
read: "VORSICHT. LEBENSGEFAHR."

An ominious steel door beckons from the corner of the room. You think you
hear the sound of something scratching against the floor in the distance.
