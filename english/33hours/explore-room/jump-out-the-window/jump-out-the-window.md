You jump out the windown and land into a pile of shrubbery.  Lucklily
this breaks your fall.  You find a pedal-powered flying machine nearby
and quickly jump in and start peddling down the hill.  It works!  The 
machine takes off and you quickly fly to your grandmother's house for
a warm plate of chocolate chip cookies--much needed afte this
harrowing adventure. :)
