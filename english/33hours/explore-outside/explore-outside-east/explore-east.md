Suddenly a car shows up and it's heading right towards you.

You try to walk along as and pretend you don't notice it. Within a few moments it is apparent it is driving slowly behind you. The car seems quieter for a moment so you check over you left shoulder, just then you hear then engine of the car roar and every hair on your reck rises. Every joint in your body feels as though it is glued in place.

You feel frozen for a moment before you start running faster than you ever have before. It's to little avail as you can hear the car coming up close behind you. You are sure that at any moment you will feel the bite of the bumper at the back of your legs and it will all be over. You swear to yourself that it's too late but try frantically to leap to the right, out of the car's path.

All you remember is the slaps in the face of soft wet moss covered branches and leaves. Your eyes are shut but you know a rigid rock is inevitably going to find it's way to your skull as your whole body helplessly tumbles like a rag doll down the embankment ditch off the road. Your body hits a large pile of debris and branches that have been pushed off the roadway by heavy rains.

You feel cocooned in your newly made tomb of branches and leaves. You know you will feel pain as soon as you move your body so you stay still, thanking god the rock you were imaging never found it's way to your skull in your flight.

As your breath finally slows from a heavy gasp, you start to think about how best to start moving all of the debris and branches off of your self to get out. Before you move an inch you hear the car come to a screeching halt nearby and a car door slam shut quickly after...
