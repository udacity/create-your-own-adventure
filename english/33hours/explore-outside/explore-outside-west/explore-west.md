As you begin walking along the highway, you hear a voice whispering your name. You stop and turn around, but there's no one there.
You decide to ignore it and keep walking. Either the voice is in your head and you're insane, or whoever is whispering wishes to remain unseen;
either way, nothing you can do about it.
As the sun sets, you realize you're getting tired and need rest.
