Seven a.m., waking up in the morning.

The sun on your face is the first thing you become aware of.

You instinctively put your hand up to shield your eyes from the brightness.

Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs.

You're still in your clothes and are lying in the middle of a bed in a cheap motel room

Seein' everything, the time is goin'.

You have no idea where you are or how you got here.

Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal.

You sit up and immediately feel pain on the back of your head.

Some dried blood cakes the pillow you were lying on.

Your wallet and mobile phone are gone. In fact, your pockets are completely empty.

Gotta get down to the bus stop.
