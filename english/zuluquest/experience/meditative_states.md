People have a conscious managerial mind of classical world of space, time, forms and ideas,
a deep quantum self of infinite possibilities, and a field mind that includes surrounding people.

When things change and old maps of reality no longer work, it can be helpful to allow the 
conscious managerial mind to temporarily step aside and allow the creative deep self to
come up with new maps of reality.

To do so, you can let yourself connect to your felt body center in a relaxed and focused way,
like professional athletes do. Then you can connect to your positive goal, stated in 5 words
or less. After that connect to your resources: pleasurable memories, symbols or people who
mean a lot for you.

Just allow the flow of generative process to happen.
