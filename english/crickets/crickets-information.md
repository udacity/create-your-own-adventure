You stumble upon an ancient tablet covered with arcane glyphs. A faint chirruping sound seems to be coming from behind the tablet. Suddenly a deep voice from behind you intones "Before you lies the testament of the ancient cricket gods."  You attempt to turn around to see who is speaking but find yourself frozen in place unable to turn your head.  The glyphs begin to morph and swim as though alive.  Fear courses through your blood as the sound of insectile chirruping begins to crescendo.
