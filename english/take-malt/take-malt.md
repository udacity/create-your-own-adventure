Nothing happens. But...you feel a strange sensation rippling through your
body. You begin to change. Energy and malted milk course through your veins, 
while your skin transforms before your very eyes into milk chocolate. 
You fall to the ground, unconscious. 

...

You awake to discover that, through some strange magic, 
you have become THE ASTOUNDING MALT-BALL, protector of the innocent
and improver of milk-shakes.
