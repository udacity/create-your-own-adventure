You begin to yell for Egon.

You hear Egon and Raymond. The sounds are barely audible but you make out some words. 

"Stand back"

You jump away from the wall as it begins to glow and grow a bit larger. 

The glow grows to a blinding white light. 

You hear a large pop as you go flying back to land on some large marshmallow chunks. 

You notice you are in Mahattan and Egon is in full gear. 

"are you ok?" Egon says. 

"yep"

"you want to go get breakfast?" Egon asks.
