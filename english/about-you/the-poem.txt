I am lying here on my bed,

It’s 2:43 am and yes I am thinking about you.

I get up with a shaky head,

Its noon and yes I dreamt about you.

I am in the window seat,  

It’s raining and yes it reminds me about you.

I am listening to songs sweet,

It’s angelic and yes it drowns me in the sea of thoughts about you.



Classroom’s full of noises, shouts, and squeals,

And I realize that’s how my heart beats when I think about you.

I‘m questioned what’s wrong, what’s it that your heart conceals,

Too afraid, I digress them away and find myself back in the labyrinth of thoughts about you.

Organic disheartens me, as I try to find solace in calculus,

Worsening is all it does pushing me back to the cozy palace of thoughts about you.

I take on the zombies with my techniques fabulous,

Not unchanged; they no longer provide that diversion from thinking about you.



I sit in the stands, looking at the cars,

It's windy and yes I look for the warmth which is this feeling about you.

I look up to the moon and the stars,

It’s captivating and yes they wrap me back to the dismal thoughts about you.

I memorize all the precipitates that are red,

It’s boring and yes I think about you.

I lay back down on my bed,

It’s 2:43 am and yes I am thinking about you.
