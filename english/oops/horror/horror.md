Horror

This is too much you think. You have to get your pants off.
You grab your pants by the waste and begin to pull downward.
It is at this moment that you remember that not only do your pants glow but they stretch as well.
Your discomfort and disgust is quickly replaced by horror as, in seemingly slow motion, your most recent
mistake begins to shoot upward.
There is nothing you can do but regret all the choices in your life that have lead to this very moment.
You gasp in shock as you wake up. Just a dream, but you take a valuable lesson from it.
Waterproof stretchy pants are dangerous in pinch.
