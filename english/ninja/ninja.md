my game
Boy or I'll hoes you
Life is tough
When I get stuck
When my time is up
I push through
Till I break-break-break
on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker

Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain
It's not sore
Don't ask for kak or
You'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive


After that episode,

You feel like your singing has reached its ultimate
ability, and never in your life will you reach this level
of skill or readiness again...

You decide to do the unthinkable...

No way! I don't have the guts to follow my dreams like that!

Knees weak, arms spaghetti, vomit on spaghetti already

[Back to reality](../marshmallow.md) ohp there goes spaghetti
