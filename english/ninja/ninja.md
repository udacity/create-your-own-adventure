my game
Boy or I'll hoes you
Life is tough
When I get stuck
When my time is up
I push through
Till I break-break-break
on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker

Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain
It's not sore
Don't ask for kak or
You'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive
