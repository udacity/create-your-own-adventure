You decide to order a medium size pepperoni pizza, because obviously pepperoni is 
the best. You sit in front of your computer to study, you put the pizza next to you 
and you start eating. Before long, you look to your side and see an empty pizza 
container! You were actually so hungry you ate the entire pizza by yourself!

This is a true story that happened to me a few days ago, but the pizza was ordered 
from the pizza parlor I work at rather than Domino's.
