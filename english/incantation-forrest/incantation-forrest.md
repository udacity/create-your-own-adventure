Everything is black and you begin to hear the incantation softly in your ears:

"Spongy and soft gets gooey when hot,
spongy and soft gets gooey when hot,
combine all the elements bring heat to cold,
tasting your sweet center will please the Gods"

You open your eyes but its blurry all they can make out is a orange and yellow light towards the crackling sound.

At this point you notice your hand grasping at along stick and on its end more of this misterious light.

As your eyes gain focus you begin to look around and trees surround you. BANG! the light gets brighter.

"Its a camp fire" you whisper. Now turning your attention to the object sitting at the end of the stick.

"A marshmallow?! is it [magic](../magic/magic.md)?".

For the strangest reason you remember that night the [cat needed feeding](../animal/animal.md) which is weird.

Nothing seems to make sense so you shout out loud "[this is.. IMPOSSIBLE!](../impossible/impossible.md)" or is it?..
