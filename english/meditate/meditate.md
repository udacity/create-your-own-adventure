So you begin to meditate for 30 minutes and when you finish, you feel more refreshed than ever.

Clearing your mind and obserivng your thought, now your are more focued and ready to take on the day.

And you feel like you need to do something, but what ...

Afterwards, you decide to:

[invite friends to party with you](../invite-friends/friends.md)

[begin your journey](../explore-outside/explore-outside.md)

[do Yoga for 30 min](../yoga/yoga.md)
