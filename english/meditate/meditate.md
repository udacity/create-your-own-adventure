You recently read that meditation helps you feel more awake, relieves stress, and helps you prepare for the day ahead.

So you begin to meditate for 30 minutes and when you finish, you feel more refreshed than ever.

Afterwards, you decide to:

[dance with joy](../dance/dance.md)

[invite friends to party with you](../invite-friends/invite-friends.md)

[begin your journey](../explore-outside/explore-outside.md)
