You decide to take the pain since the cat looks adorable. 

Fortunately, the cat kept its claws restracted so it turned out that it didn't really hurt that much.

The cat suddenly jumps up and looks confused and sheepish as though it wondered what kind of madness had just come over him.

You laugh at your cat for being so silly.
