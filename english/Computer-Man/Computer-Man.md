You're walking down the street, and the glint of a flashy new computer
catches your eye through the window.  You walk into the store, and
meet.......the [computer man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm4E8TcjF70).
Turns out he's a big fan of Super Mario Galaxy. Do you offer to play [a level with him?](http://downloads.khinsider.com/album_images/6987-pcfgdyrjfq.jpg)
