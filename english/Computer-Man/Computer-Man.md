You're walking down the street, and the glint of a flashy new computer
catches your eye through the window.  You walk into the store, and
meet.......the [computer man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm4E8TcjF70).

He takes in your presence, top to bottom, before smirking and welcoming you into his store.
however, there is a catch you must part with your shoes before moving any further...strange
