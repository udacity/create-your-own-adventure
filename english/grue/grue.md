The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its
favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its
fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have
survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale. 

All grue-cataloguers have as fodder for their artist's renderings are large many-
toed footprints and the occasional fist-sized, roughly grapefruit-spoon-shaped 
tooth (thought to be grue baby teeth.) 

Often spotted in groups of 3-5 known as gruesomes. 

A grue also smells repulsive.

[Oh yeah!? If so few have survived a grue encounter, how do we know about its smell?](../grue/grue-smell.md)
