At this point, you are swimming calmly out in the ocean.
All of a sudden, the water turns very still and you feel
in the presence of some larger creature.

You assume that maybe there's a big fish or shark swimming
near you...

Getting very nervous.  Starting to breath anxiously...

Maybe you're overreacting, but you're plenty scared!

Do you quickly swim back to shore, do you 
[set your mind free](../yoga/mind/yoga_mind.md), or 
do you [Learn to breathe](../yoga/breathe/breathe.md)?
