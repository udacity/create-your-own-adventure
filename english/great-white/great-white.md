At this point, you are swimming calmly out in the ocean.
All of a sudden, the water turns very still and you feel
in the presence of some larger creature.

You assume that maybe there's a big fish or shark swimming
near you...

Getting very nervous.  Starting to breath anxiously...

Maybe you're overreacting, but you're plenty scared!

Do you quickly swim back to shore, or do you gentle tread 
water waiting for the moment to pass?
