You pause for a moment and stare up at the sky, 
ignoring the marshmallows or whatever junk is going on below you. 

Your moment of reflection ends suddenly when you realise you 
are in fact sitting at your computer reading this story. 

However, you are still confused as to what you just read 
and you go on to wonder where this story will take you next.

It turns out this particular author is lazy and the story ends.

Sorry.
