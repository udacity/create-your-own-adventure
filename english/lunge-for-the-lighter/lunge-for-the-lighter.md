You lunge for the lighter, hoping to get to it before the marshmallow hand has
a chance to get to it. Unfortunately you can't seem to will any speed into your
strike at all. The marshmallow hand picks up the lighter and tucks it under its
pinky finger in what appears to be the a single deft movement. The hand snaps
its confectionary phalanges and wags its index finger at you as if to tell you
"no!". It confidently saunters to a corner of the room. You barely notice, but
you see the hand shaking a bit. Like it's some sort of inaudible laughter.
The hand turns and points at you one last time, this time with two fingers,
aimed right at your eyes and disappears into the marshmallows.
