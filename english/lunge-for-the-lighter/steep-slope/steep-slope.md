Against your better judgment--what's left of it at any rate--you make a mad
dash for the opening with the steep downward slope. Something about the whole
situation reeks of deception, and you have a vague recollection that you've seen
this opening before...while being chased by marshmallow men who were shooting
lasers. As you approach the opening, you see that the slope is much steeper than
it first appeared, and you can't see where it leads. Just then, you notice a
big red button above the opening.

You decide against just diving blindly into the opening, and, in a flash of what could be called intuition, you 
punch the button. This results in two other openings being revealed to the right of the steeply sloping one. You 
pause. The first of these new openings reveals a tunnel that ascends slightly, and curves gently away to the right.
Oddly, it seems to made of stone, unlike the rest of what you have seen of this strange place. You can hear the 
faint sound of dripping liquid coming from the tunnel. It is lit from above, every two meters or so, by small
lights with wires connecting each of them The second new opening reveals what appears to be a hallway, lit in the 
same manner as the first, lined with pictures of various types of bird-like lizards wearing very ... um, unique
clothing. You can just barely hear odd animalistic noises from some point far down the hallway.
