The marshmallows underneath you give out and you fall into a large dark cavern, feeling a sharp
pain upon landing.  After getting up you immediately fall to your knees and wince in agony.  You
look down and grab your leg, noticing the trusty fork, 3 inches deep in your leg.  Your pants 
start to feel damp to the touch which leads you to use the rope and leather jacket to apply 
pressure and tie off the wound.  That’s when you smell a faint aroma of cinnamon and see the 
ground bares a striking resemblance to a graham cracker.
