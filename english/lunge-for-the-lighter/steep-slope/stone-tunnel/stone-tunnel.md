As you enter the tunnel, you realize that what you thought was the sound of dripping liquid was the sound of two 
grey, raccoon-like creatures "talking" to one another. The smaller of the two, at a meter-high, looks you in the 
eye for a moment, and hands you a half-meter long, sharpened, metal rod with unintelligble markings on it. The 
simplistic designs lead you to believe that the raccoons made these markings. Each of them has one of the rods
too. They "speak" to you, and they gesture down the tunnel. As they turn and walk away further into the tunnel,
you get the feeling that they want you to follow them.
