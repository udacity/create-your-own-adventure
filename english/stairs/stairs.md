You race for the twisting stair case. The officer is catching up,
but you race up the stairs. As you round your way up the stairs you
hear the officer pounding up behind you. You glance back and see
him only a few steps away!

Heart pounding you dash into a corridor pushing doors as you go. Finally one opens. You step inside to discover a meeting taking place. Calming yourself down you calmly walk to the window and say 'HEalth and Saftey", push the window open and climb out.
