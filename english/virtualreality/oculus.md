You try to move your legs but when you look at them they won't budge! You remember this 
feeling when you first got your Oculus Rift, you must have fallen asleep with it on
while playing Marshmallow Kingdom again!

You take it off and return to the real world.
Checkout Samsung GEAR VR for an amazing experience.

But next day the same thing happens to you again.

You have accidently entered into Kafka's world that has been redesigned
by Murakami... you cannot escape it!

[Life in the real world](problems/realproblems.md).

You try to take off the oculus gear again to no avail.  
You faintly hear Sonny and Cher's "I Got You Babe" in the background. 
After scanning the room you see Hansel smoking his joint. 
He's in the exact same position as he was yesterday.


You walk up to Hansel and start to ask him what happened, but he does not answer. 
It is then that you notice a yellow exclamation point above his head!

I was sure he went to a denial state. I only had one choice... shake him. Shake Hansel, shake!
