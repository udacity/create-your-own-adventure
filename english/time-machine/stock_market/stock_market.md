Armed with your foresight, you invest in dot-com stocks of the 90s but sell
just before the bubble bursts. You then invest in Apple stocks in the early
2000s and buy the first ten thousand BitCoins while they're still dirt cheap.

Unfortunately for the world. your actions had consequences. Your "fast-and-loose"
investing, while earning you billions, led to an even faster rise of populism,
global warming, poverty, and generalized tooth decay. The world nearly implodes
on itself, until miraculously, this git repository is discovered in an inexplicable
time-loop. The world then turns on you, having realized you brought forth its
current apocalpytic nightmare. Have fun dealing with the raging mobs!
