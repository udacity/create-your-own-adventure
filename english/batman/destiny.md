Bruce Wayne was destined to be [Batman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman).

What are you destined to be?
And suddenly it strikes to you, "Why am I dressed as Batman?"
Whatever I [look so cool](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2016/07/ASBM1.jpg).

And it gets you thinking about your life again.
Do I dream of being a cool guy because I am not [cool in real life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loser_(hand_gesture))?
Or
do I dream because I am a [dreamer](../dream/dream.md)?
