This is a parable about my parakeets. I have a pair of parakeets.

Perry and Paris.

They don't trust anyone. They are a pair of paranoid parakeets.

Perry wanted to be a paratrooper. But he jumped with a parasol instead of a
parachute. The paramedic said he was paralyzed (and also that he had parasites)
so he had to change his paradigm.  Now he'll just become a paralegal.

Paris doesn't want to get caught in any paradox like that; he just wants to
be a parakeet of paradise. 

Forgive my paragraph, I was only trying to create a parody.
