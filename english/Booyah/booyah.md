I finally understand git and gitHub. I actually understand branches and merges.

What am I going to do with my new found knowledge?
The world is now my [oyster.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_oyster)

Have some booyah stew
or call a [spirit](../call-spirit/call-spirit.md)

This sounds great. The second [user](https://github.com/schen57) also just understand git and github. It is all live and well that we know a little bit about git and github right, first user? So what should the first story be?
Should it be an adventure of the great [giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_(mythology)) or should it be the story of some military beefcake celebration, such as the title suggests - "Booyah" ?

This is interesting, that you and I don't know each other but get to work on this collective story-telling together. Maybe we should check out some other people's stories such as [experience](../experience/white-star/white-star.md)
