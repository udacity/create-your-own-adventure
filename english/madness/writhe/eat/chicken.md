The chicken is glorious, crispy breading on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside.  
You gorge yourself until all of the chicken is gone.  On the bottom of the bucket is a message.

You read the message and it says, "Today's the day you make your escape, Agent 006. You
have been a prisoner in a Russian facility that specializies in experimental
psychoactive chemical warfare. Eat this note as if it were another piece of chicken and
wait for further instruction."

Do you:

Blindly trust what is written on the note, eat it, and [wait](wait/wait.md). 

[Show](show/show.md) the camera the note and angrily demand to what is going on.
