You writhe in agony for ten thousand millenia until 
sweet death descends upon you.

WEEP MORTAL!

But it was only a dream.  You wake soaked with sweat with a bucket of chicken next to the bed.  In the corner of the room, a camera watches silently.

Do you:
[Eat some chicken](eat/chicken.md)?
[Cover camera with chicken thigh](camera/chicken.md)?
