Passion makes the old medicine new:
Passion lops off the bough of weariness.
Passion is the elixir that renews:
how can there be weariness
when passion is present?
Oh, don't sigh heavily from fatigue:
seek passion, seek passion, seek passion!

Rumi

Sometimes, however, pursuing passion is as
dangerous as indulging fairytale hopes; it
could drive one insane or lead them [asray](pursuing-passion/fairytale-hopes.md).
