Passion makes the old medicine new:
Passion lops off the bough of weariness.
Passion is the elixir that renews:
how can there be weariness
when passion is present?
Oh, don't sigh heavily from fatigue:
seek passion, seek passion, seek passion!

Rumi

When you find passion, be sure to lick it...

Lick it off just like [these guys](http://rhettandlick.com/) did.
