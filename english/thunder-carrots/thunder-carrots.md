You dream of walking to the microwave in the kitchen.
And you warm up a little soup. But then something happens.

Out from the microwave, a dozen exploding thunder carrots swarm you smothering you as you cower.
You fall to the ground and hit your head. You come to, and,

Yes!

That's how to [clone](https://goo.gl/IqYvlE) a remote!

So you get to cloning. And get [back to your journey](../marshmallow.md).

"That was strange" you think. Perhaps the shock from the thunder carrots fried something in my brain because I
could have sworn that I just literally traveled THROUGH cyberspace...like, my whole body went there and back again.
