You start to smash the rats with your feet and punch the ones that jump on you,
but no matter how bravely you fight, they start to eat your body until the bitter end...
until you suddenly remember you left a huge stash of darts dipped in rat poison
under your bed.  Time to get to work!

Wow that's... interesting.
