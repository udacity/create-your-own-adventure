You awaken with a start as you realize your marshmellowy abode
has been cooked to the point where it's a golden brown, perfect
for the eating! However, you can see the exit slowly but surely
start to get shrouded by flames.

Do you:

Eat the golden brown marshmellow walls

or

Escape the house like a sane individual!
