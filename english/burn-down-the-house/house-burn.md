As you continue sleeping and enter into a slumber, you don't realise when the entire
house begins to collapse. First the roof, then the walls, the entire space is filled
with fumes that continue to raise while choking you in your sleep.

Suddenly, your whole beautiful dream of your crush now turns into nightmare as you
slip into the abyss of eternity. Just before that happens, you hear a loud noise as
of a bang coming from downstairs. This may be the firemen or more destruction as
a result of the flames, as you continue to wonder the cause of the noise, you slip
into a coma and wake up only to realise it was just a dream.
