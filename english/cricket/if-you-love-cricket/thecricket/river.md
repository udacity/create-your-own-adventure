GREAT!
You have crossed the river. As you walk down the street a car passes by and asks you where you are going.
I'm going to the Opera to listen to Cricri- you say.
Well, you are in luck! I am CriCri!

CriCri picks you up, you have a nice chat and tea at the Opera. You have a great day.

By the time you are back the bridge is back and you cross without any issues to go home.
