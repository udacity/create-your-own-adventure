You finish scolding yourself for whining and decide
to adapt.
You notice that walking around in flip-flops is normal here.
On the bus, in the mall, in a restaurant, at school.
You go into 7-eleven and buy yourself a snazzy pair,
yellow bottom with purple straps.

You realize you're feet have been suppressed for two decades.
You are liberated.
