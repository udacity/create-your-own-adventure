You feel the walls until you find the jell-o door.

Excited for the day ahead of you, you walk through it to go to work.

There are two paths outside. One leads into a forest. One leads into the mountains.

In the distance, you notice a tower that has caught fire, but is smoking a deep shade of purple.

You have a slight cold.  You might want to call in sick to work.
