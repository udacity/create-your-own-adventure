You tell the cougar your name

You know you should run, but you can't.  You ask the cougar her name.  

"Sara"

You think that Sara is an odd name for a cougar, 

while you might have expected something more like "grrmph" or "raaaagghh,"

but you figure you'd better be polite and let it slide.

You ask Sara how she can speak to humans

She says "Be careful asking questions you don't already know the answer to"
