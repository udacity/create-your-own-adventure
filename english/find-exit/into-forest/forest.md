The air is still. There are no noises from animals. 

In the dark shadows of the forest, you sense the presence of something watching you.

However it is autumn, and a Haiku inspires you:

Dead leaf on the ground

Green in life you fed the tree

Red you'll help the Spring.


Then you reflect on your path to this point and time:

Version control rules

Managed projects is the aim

Peace of mind the gain.

But only for a short while

That something watching you emerges from the shadows

It's a cougar, stalking it's prey.  It approaches you 

You can do nothing but wait for it to make it's move

Then it asks "What's your name?"
