There once was a prince who was hungry.

It was lunch time and he had a lot of work to do. But his grumbling stomach was too powerful to handle.

He decided to eat the biggest burger in the kingdom.

It was this [burger](http://www.supersizedmeals.com/food/images/articles/20090615-Big_League_Burger_2.jpg).

Satisfied with the burger, He asked for the chef to come in his palace to thank him.

Little did he know, that burger will change everything he knows....
