There once was a prince who was hungry.

It was lunch time and he had a lot of work to do. But his grumbling stomach was too powerful to handle.

He decided to eat the biggest burger in the kingdom.

It was this [burger](http://www.supersizedmeals.com/food/images/articles/20090615-Big_League_Burger_2.jpg).

Satisfied with the burger, He asked for the chef to come in his palace to thank him.

Little did he know, that burger will change everything he knows....

But more on that later. For now, the prince must tend to his royal duties.

But he was still hungry.
