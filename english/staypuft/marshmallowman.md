You scoop up piles of marshmallow and build a giant stay puft marshmallow snowman.
After a while, his poofy smile begins to look a bit more menacing and a whole lot creepy.
In fact, you are no longer sure if the marshmallow man is simply settling under his ginormous weight, 
or if, in fact, he has begun to move toward you!

When you're done, do you:

[Go back to sleep](../sleep/more-sleep/more-sleep.md)?

[Start eating the walls](../eating-walls/eating-marshmallows.md)?

[Explore outside](../explore-outside/explore-outside.md)?
