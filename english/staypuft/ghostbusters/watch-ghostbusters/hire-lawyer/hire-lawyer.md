It is no surprise that Columbia Pictures decides that Udacity and all contributers to this repository 
have broken several copyright laws when publishing unauthorized content about Ghostbusters on a public domain, 
in this case "GitHub", and sends a cease and desist letter to this effect.  
After all you have been through, including being inside a giant sentient marshmallow and nearly being run over by a cab, you now face the potential for financial ruin.
Luckily you realize you are broke, leaving the 
expenses of hiring an attorney to Udacity and GitHub, who hopefully have a boatload of $$!
