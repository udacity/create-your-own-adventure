It is no surprise that Columbia Pictures decides that Udacity and all contributers to this repository have broken several copyright laws when publishing unauthorized content about Ghostbusters on a public domain, in this case "GitHub", and sends a cease and desist letter to this effect.  After all you have been through, including being inside a giant sentient marshmallow and nearly being run over by a cab, you now face the potential for financial ruin.  Luckily you realize you are broke, leaving the expenses of hiring an attorney to Udacity and GitHub, who hopefully have a boatload of $$!
