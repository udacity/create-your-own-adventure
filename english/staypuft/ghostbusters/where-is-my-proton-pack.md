After realizing that you are in fact within THE giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man himself, you decide to
call Dr. Peter Venkman for assistance.

Much to your surpise he arrives with the entire ghostbusters team, and with proton packs blazing you
end up landing in a soft, gooey marshmallow mess in the middle of a busy New York street.

From the looks of things, it will take a while to get this mess cleaned up! 

Just out of reach, you see a discarded proton pack.

You try to pull yourself out of the sticky mass, but with a sinking feeling you realise you are stuck.

You look up in time to see a taxi cab skidding toward you through the gloopy guck. You have seconds to act.

After so much excitement you decide to:
