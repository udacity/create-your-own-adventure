You take your crown and raise your arms with glee (and power)!

"ALL HAIL THE WALRUS KING!"

You rule till your dying days for however long a walrus can live. 
When you pass, a mighty statue is constructed in your honor. It 
is made as a walrus would make a statue, so it's mostly sand and 
rotting fish patted into a mound. With a very short passing of time, 
you statue is eventually flattened, but hey... It's the thought that 
counts, right?
