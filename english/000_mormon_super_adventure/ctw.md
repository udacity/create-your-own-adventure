Choosing the Wrong will ultimately lead to your destruction.  The only way is through JESUS CHRIST.  Through HIS atonement there will be one death that must be accounted for that cannot be blamed on that one's own sin...this death of the innocent savior will be on the head of satan, and every excuse and finger that this fallen angel can direct at you or anyone else will be done.  And ultimately in so doing, all pointed fingers will lead back directly to himself in which his endless state of misery will be an everlasting one.  But it will be at his own will.  Please listen and choose righteousness.  First, you must love the LORD GOD with all your heart soul and mind...Second, you must love others as if they were yourself.  On these two commandments hang all the laws of the prophets, even our modern day prophets...THUS SAITH THE LORD!
