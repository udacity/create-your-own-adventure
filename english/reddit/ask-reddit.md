So I decide to pull out my phone and see if I can find any useful information on Reddit.

First a post to r/askreddit - Help! I'm stuck in a marshmallow room. What do I do reddit?

Chances are this will die a lonely death sitting in the new queue.

lets try a search on the off chance that reddit search returns anything remotely useful.

- r/MarshmallowPeopleHate banned by admins as part of the new harassment policy. 

- r/MarshmallowPorn   Yeah, that one's staying blue.

Not much help there.

Oh look..[a kitten laying in marshmallows in r/awww](http://i.imgur.com/NXmEI.jpg)

Oh look, a cute puppy...

Consider unsubscribing from r/awww...

And that, my friends, is how I spent the last week.

But finally i stumbled upon [r/outside](outside_subreddit/r_outside.md)
