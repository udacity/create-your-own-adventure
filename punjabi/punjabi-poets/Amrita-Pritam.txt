Her poem ‘Ajj Aakhan Waris Shah Nu‘ is a hauntingly beautiful poem addressed to the author of immortal epic of love, Heer Ranjha.

Lyrics of Poem in English:

Today, I call Waris Shah, “Speak from your grave,”
And turn to the next page in your book of love,
Once, a daughter of Punjab cried and you wrote an entire saga,
Today, a million daughters cry out to you, Waris Shah,
Rise! O’ narrator of the grieving! Look at your Punjab,
Today, fields are lined with corpses, and blood fills the Chenab.
