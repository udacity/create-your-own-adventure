The name India is derived from Indus, which originates from the Old Persian word Sindhi.
The latter term stems from the Sanskrit word Sindhu, which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River.
The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ινδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus".
