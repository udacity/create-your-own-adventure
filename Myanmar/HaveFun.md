I was trying to type in Myanmar. However, the text editor I was using doesn't seem to support Myanmar Font.
Anyway, it has been a journey and I am proud that I have come so far learning git and github.
Before this online class, I had no idea about what "git" and "github" are.
I have seen them quite a lot in the news and I wondered what are they?
The day has finally arrived! I have finished the course. Yay~~

I don't know what other people write about. Honestly, I read one and it was about Jesus and love. 
Well, at least it is better than pornographic stuffs. 

I had no idea about the source file when I first clone it to my repo. Then I saw folders, named accordingly to their country and under each folder, there is(are) folder(s) named after the topics of the letter. 

Sad thing is when you don't see your country name. Well, there are more than 200 countries on the earth and there are only a few on the repo. So, it is not really a "thing to brag about". Anyway, if you are reading this, I guess you are from Myanmar or you have some sort of relationship with the country or maybe you are just a reader who just like to read.
