You are suddenly reminded of thanksgiving dinners you had as a child at your Grandma's house and an overwhelming
urge comes over you to make one of those weird marshmallow Jell-O fruit salads that you never liked.

Astonishingly, in your straightjacket pocket you find an orange Jell-O packet, some canned fruit, a bowl, and a
mixing spoon (yes, straightjackets have big pockets). You pluck small pieces of marshmallow from the walls and
prepare to make the weirdest marshmallow Jell-O fruit salad ever.

Some people have trouble after eating these
