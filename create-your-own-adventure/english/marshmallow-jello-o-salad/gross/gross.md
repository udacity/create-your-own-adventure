You think about making the jello marshmallow mold for another couple minutes but then
realize how terrible they truly are. You remember how in the 60's people used to cook
fish in jello and different meats in jello and get nauseous just thinking about it.

So now youre stuck in your straight jacket with fruit, a bowl, some orange jell-o
and a big spoon.

What will you do with these things? you could try to plant the jell-o
like seeds, or you could wear the bowl like a helmet...
