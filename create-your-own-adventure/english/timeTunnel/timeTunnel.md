Upon exiting the time tunnel, it is clear you have entered the future.
There are flying cars complete the the whirring noise.
However, marshmellows have been banned.
This must be corrected, but how?
Suddenly, a cat walks up and says "Is that a marshmallow on your fork?"

You quickly stuff the marshmellow in your mouth and garble out a quick, "no".

The cat suspiciously notes, "alrighty then, nyaan. Good thing it wasn't, otherwise, 
I would've had to take you away, nyaan. I'll be off now!"

As you watch the cat pounce off into the distance, you feel a moment of relief, 
as you had almost been captured by the totalitarian state of cats. 
What a strange future, you think to yourself.

You look around to develop a better sense of where in the world you are right now 
and you spot a mysteriously large, robust door, 
decorated with an assortment of sweets, the likes of which, are rarely seen.
