You cock the shotgun and blast the polar bear in the face. Brain matter flys all
over the marshmallow wall.
Suddenly the brain matter starts to disintegrate the wall.
You see sunlight peeking through.
After a while the wall is gone and you are free. 
You find you are on an island surrounded by a sea of hot chocolate.
The chocolate foams and steams.

Scoop up the remains with a mug and [drink that bear](../bear/bear.md).
