You lunge for the gun.

But the badger has much quicker reflexes than you expected,
and he runs for the gun as well, beating you to it.

The gun is too big for him, obviously, and doesnt have the
manual dexterity to pick it up and shoot you with it. As he 
fumbles with the gun, BANG! He shoots himself in the heart.

Chunks of badger start falling all around you.

You can't help but chuckle.

'Cocky basterd.' You say, as you walk away and take out a 
cigarette. As you light it, you remember another lesson from
your younger sunday school days:

pride goeth before the fall.
