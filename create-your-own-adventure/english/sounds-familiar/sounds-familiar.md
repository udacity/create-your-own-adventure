This story rattling around in your head sure sounds familiar.

You seem to remember hearing about someone giving up their only son somewhere...

Was it as you were dozing off to the drone of some old guy standing in front of
a bunch of pews as you were surrounded by blue-haired ladies that smelled 
sickeningly of sweet rose perfume on a Sunday morning?

Or maybe it was when you were playing video games on the couch while some cheesy
movie from the 80s was playing on the TV in the background.

Maybe it was at that comicon.
