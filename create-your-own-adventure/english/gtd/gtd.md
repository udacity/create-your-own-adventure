Good, seems like you really want to get some work done.
Open a new tab in your browser, and do a Google
search for "Getting Things Done".

Or if you really, really need to work,
just close this window and everything else you
opened while trying to finish the udacity course
and just get to work.

Come back to the marshmallow file and choose the 
"that" option when you're done with your work.

Cheers!
