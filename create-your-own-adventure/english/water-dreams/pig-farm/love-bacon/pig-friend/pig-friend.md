You search for another pig, and find one rather swiftly.

"Hello," you say (in Pig Latin, of course). "Do you like bacon?"

"Yes, I do," says the other pig, sounding reluctant and full of life regrets.

"Me too! But we're pigs, so that makes me feel horrible!" you exclaim.

"Me too!"

And so, you found a pig friend to commiserate, and were thereby able to slightly lessen the burden of your guilt.
