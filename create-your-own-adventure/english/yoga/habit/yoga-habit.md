It's hard to build a habit of doing yoga on a regular basis. Here are some ways
to make it easier to get going:

1. Just do it!
2. Get a yoga partner
3. If lethargic, just start off with 1 minute of breathing.
4. Commit to only 10-15 minutes of yoga a day- this is doable for most people!
5. Use YouTube yoga videos if you can't get out of the house for a class.
