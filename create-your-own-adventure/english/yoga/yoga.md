Yoga originated in India.
Starting out in child pose, you start to zoom out from the environment and take focus on your breathing.

There are many types of yoga - Ashtanga, Bikram, Sivananda, Iyengar etc.

Going through the poses, you feel your body warm up and you feel the energy flowing through your body.

Calm music starts to play quietly from all directions.

You start becoming transcendent.
