You vaguely remember something from your childhood, something about marshmallows

and a strange tune begins forming in your mind...

"If there's something strange"

"in your neighborhood"

"Who ya gonna call?"

"GHOSTBUSTERS!"

You immediately look around and notice a marshmallow phone.  You pick it up and dial the Ghostbusters.

The air is suddenly filled with the sounds of blaring sirens as the Ghostbuster mobile

smashes through the marshmallow wall beside you barely missing you.

The marshmallow wall oozes down to close off the  hole that the Ghostbuster mobile made

as it made its entrance.  Out pop the four ghostbusters from your childhood youth.

Dr. Egon Spengler pulls out his doo-hickey which starts emitting a strange noise.

"I'm detecting an epic amount of paranormal activity from these marshmallow walls!"

Dr. Peter Venkman looks at the other 3 as they all nod to each other.

All four of them pull out their proton packs and begin blasting the walls all around them

with their proton streams.  Pockets of sunlight and the outside world reveal themselves as the

marshmallow walls begin melting away into a puddle.

"This is a piece of cake compared to Mr. Stay Puff" yells Dr. Ray Stantz.

He props his proton gun under his armpit and continues firing as he pulls out a cigarette to light it.

During this process his proton stream accidently crosses Dr. Egon Spengler's stream.

There is a sudden loud CRACKLE and BOOM as everything around you explodes in a ball of light

and sparkle as your body and mind are sent reeling.

You awaken to bluriness and a numbing headache as you wonder

WHERE AM I ???

a voice calls out from your right

You sense a cloaked figure with 

electric [blue eyes] (../goosebumps/goosebumps.md) approach.
