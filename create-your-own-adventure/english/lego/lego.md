The mallow man seems nice so you chat to him after walking up to him.

He decides he likes you too, so he gets out his Lego's.

He's got Star Wars, Lego Movie, space, technics, oh so much lego and you play with it all!

After a while he starts to get a bit too much, he doesn't get out much, you're bored.

You look around wondering what to do.

What would Jesus do?

What do you do next to stimulate and excite you!

But you ought to be careful, the power of the legos is not a joke!
