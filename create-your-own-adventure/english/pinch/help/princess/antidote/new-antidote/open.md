The room suddenly locks behind you as you open the door and a monster lurks in the shadows.
You feel uncomfortable and unsure of what to do now. You're doomed.

Then you remember the lighter in your jacket, you try to light it to find an escape,  but your
marshmallow fingers won't strike it. There must be some way!!
