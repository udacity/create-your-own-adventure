The marshmallow has terrorized you so much that it has become a part of you now.
It takes a thorn to remove a thorn. And you decide to make marshmallow masala chai.
Take half a cup of water. Bring it to boil. Add one and a half teaspoon of Taj mahal tea powder.
(Ahmed tea if you can find it).
Add 1 green cardamom, 1 clove, half an inch of ginger and half an inch of cinnamon stick. Let it boil for 2 minutes.
Add half a cup of milk and let it boil. And now to the best part. Add the marshmallow to the boiling hot tea. 
Rejoice as the marshmallow melts. Stir it into the tea and watch it disintegrate.
Sieve the tea into a cup and drink it hot.
The tea is done. SDo is the marshmallow.
