All of a sudden, you regret sneaking that taste of chocolate. 

The room around you feels unstable, and then seems to be growing at a rapid pace. 

Why is everythng so high now? And big? And far away? 

You look down and see a spoon on the ground next to you...except that it's bigger than you. What happened?

Oh no, the room didn't get bigger. You SHRANK! You're tiny. Small enough to sit in the spoon, even. 

Now what?? How do you either get bigger, or just get out of this mess?!
