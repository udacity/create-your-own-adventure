It's 10 p.m. and you're borging, and decide to surf on google, for stacraft 1,

an old game that you play some years ago, suddenly you read starcraft 2 

a new version with beter graphics and you give it a chance again 

visiting [Starcraft 2](http://www.starcraft2.com)

After downloading Star Craft 2, you start playing the campaign and

you find it to be the best RTS campaign you've ever played.  You had

so much fun playing it that you play through it twice more.
