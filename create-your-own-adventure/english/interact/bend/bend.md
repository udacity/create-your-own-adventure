You bend down and call out to the little marshmallow hand.

Out of the corner of your eye, you see a movement on your left side.

You turn around slightly and you see a small hand emerge from the left wall.

It moves towards you and little marshmallow hand pops out of the wall.

It seems it had the ability to blend in  and move within the walls.

You throw the lighter to the opposite end of the room.

You keep you hand extended hoping it will see you mean no harm.

After a little hesitation, it climbs onto your hand.

Soon lots of little marshmallow hands are coming out of the walls around you.

They climb onto your shoulders and hold onto your legs.

All the while they are singing and pointing above you.

You look up and realize that the room has no roof.

The sun is shining brightly and it seems to get brighter.

The whole scene fades out and you wake up in your own bed.

The alarm is blaring and it shows that its time to get ready for work.

You reach out to turn it off and touch something soft.

You open the light and can't believe what is sitting on your nightstand.

Its a stuffed marshmallow toy and next to it the yummiest smore, still warm.

You remember you wanted to eat smores for breakfast, Yet......

How did that smore get there?

You don't remember putting it there!
