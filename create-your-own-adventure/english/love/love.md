Love is one of the most exciting, rewarding and satisfying of human experiences.
Whether the love of family, friends, a child or romantic love, it is a shared human adventure.
Just as high as one might feel at the tip of that love, the lows can be devastatingly painful
when it is time to let go of that loved one. Whether needing to let go because they have passed on,
or because it is time to move on from the relationship, grief is a component.
You should grieve what was lost and accept the healing hands of time. Recognize your emotional limits,
but donâ€™t isolate yourself as you let someone go and heal from the loss.

There is no use moping around wondering the ifs, buts, could've, would've,
and should'ves. Time goes on and drags you with it. Whether you are in or
out of love, make the best of now while being aware of the worst of before.
