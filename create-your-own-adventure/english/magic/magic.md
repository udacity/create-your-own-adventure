Channel you inner Harry Potter and turn that rope into some grahm crackers.
Grab you a handfull of that marshmallow wall.
Use that lighter and make you some smores.
Eat your way out of that room and watch out for Lord Voldemort
Voldemort hates smores -- knowledge is power

You are now in the Kings Landing, looking at the Mad King on the Iron throne.
I am coming for you mad king. For I am the mother of dragons
What is dead may never die!
With my green light saber, I'll deal with this sithlord madness!

Continue on to the port and get on the big ship.
