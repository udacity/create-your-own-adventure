You've wasted enough time here. Building a marshmallow snowman was fun, but you've got ish to do.

In your earlier confusion, you didn't realize there was a door you could use to go home. So you leave.

A few days later, as you're settling down to go to sleep, trying to put the weird incident behind. Suddenly, you hear a
scrathing at the door. After a few minutes, it becomes more insistent.

Do you investigate?
