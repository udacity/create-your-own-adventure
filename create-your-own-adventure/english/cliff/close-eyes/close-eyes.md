You close your eyes and put your fate into the wind's hands.  You're excited to see where it will take you.

You pass below the clouds and the earth below you is suddenly visible.  Or it would be, if your eyes were open.

Unfortunately, with your eyes closed you fail to see that you're rapidly approaching the ground.

Your last thought is, "I can't wait until I land."
