You search for the Rubik's cube. Nobody has it. You have to get it.
You paddle miles before reaching a place which has it, the cube.
Ecstatic. Happy. Amazed. Wondering. Imagining how to solve. Coming back to reality.
Curious.
Rush back home. Start solving the cube.

Solving.

Solving.

Still solving.


Tired!!, still solving.



AAH! solved.
Tired like hell. Haven't slept for two days straight. Lay down on bed.
Went straight to sleep.
