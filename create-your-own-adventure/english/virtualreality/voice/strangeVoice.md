“You might have noticed that removing your Rift 
does not return you to reality.  This is working 
as intended.”

As you inspect your head with your hands, 
you quickly realize that the hands you are seeing 
do not match up with the hands you can actually feel.

Your hands feel like normal hands,
but your left hand looks like a trout,
and your right hand looks like a hotdog.

Suddenly you feel very tired and you're starting to fall
alseep.

Just before falling asleep, you wonder where you'll wake up...

You dream that you are a drop of water, falling through the air, 
warping and shedding small pieces of yourself as you are buffeted by the air currents.

Your mind reaches out to try and affect your shape. The water responds giving you hope 
but as you exert more and more effort, it seems harder to try and do anything.

The other droplets around you seem content to fall as preordained by physical forces of the world. 
Perhaps they once fought to control their destiny as well, but today they were firmly entrenched in the water cycle.
 Falling from tens of thousands of feet to the ground was an ordinary Saturday Morning. 

But this was different for you, a first rain, you only have one of those. 
You peer down below you and see you have two choices, left or right. The Fish Sanctuary or The pig farm?
