They're black they're brown they're up they're down  
They're in they're out they're all about  
They're far they're near they're gone they're here  
They're quick and slick, they're insincere  
Beware, beware, be a very wary bear  

A Heffalump or Woozle is very confusel  
The Heffalump or woozle's very sly  
sly, sly, sly  

They come in ones and twoosels  
But if they so choosels  
Before your eyes you'll see them multiply  
ply, ply, ply  

They're extra-ordinary, so better be wary  
Because they come in every shape and size  
size, size, size  

If honey's what you covet you'll find that they love it  
Because they guzzle up the things you prize  

They're green they're blue they're pink they're white  
They're round they're square they're a terrible sight  
They tie themselves in horrible knots  
They come in stripes or polka-dots  
Beware, beware, be a very wary bear  

They're extra-ordinary, so better be wary  
Because they come in every shape and size  
size, size, size  

If honey's what you covet you'll find that they love it  
Because they'll guzzle up the things you prize  

They're black they're brown they're up their down  
They're in they're out they're all about  
They're far they're near they're gone they're here  
They're quick and slick, they're insincere  
Beware, beware, beware, beware, beware....
