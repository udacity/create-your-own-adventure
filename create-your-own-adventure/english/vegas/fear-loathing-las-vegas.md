Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, 
or at least a Main Era -- the kind of peak that never comes again. 

There was madness in any direction, There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was 
right, that we were winning.

No, this is not a good town for psychedelic drugs. Reality itself is too twisted.

No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets 
a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it off to forced conscious expansion: Tune 
in, freak out, get beaten.

Too weird to live, too rare to die!
