You equip your trusty iron pickaxe and start digging downwards.

You are immediately surrounded by dirt and can't see a thing, but you keep digging.

After a while you dig through what appears to be the ceiling of a huge natural cave,

Since you were digging downwards you fell straight to the floor!

Luckily the cave wasn't as tall as you tought and you get up without a scratch.

The cave is covered in darkness...

You decide to use your lighter.

Your eyes struggle to adjust to the sudden brightness. Once they do...

The cave lights up a little and you can somewhat see where you are.

Ahead of you lie two diverging tunnels, one goes to your left and the other one to your right.

Behind you a single path...

Do you go [left?](goleft/goleft.md)

Or maybe go [right?](goright/goright.md) 

Or [dig yourself out and return to collecting wood?](../gather_wood/focus_on_gathering_wood/focus_on_gathering_wood.md)
