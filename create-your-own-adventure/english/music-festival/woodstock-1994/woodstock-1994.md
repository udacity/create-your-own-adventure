You're trapped in a memory of Woodstock '94.  Were these your experiences,
or do they belong to someone else... perhaps [many others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz227EU_1mU)?

You slide in the mud while being entertained by:

[Blind Melon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xph8pPJMB8)

[Primus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-HUK8qR9QA)

[Nine Inch Nails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lbFfiLAj_A)

Before your favorite band can play, you are
back in [the forest](../../forest/forest.md) again.
