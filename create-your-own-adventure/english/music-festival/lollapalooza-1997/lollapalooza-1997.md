You leave work at Bell's Amusement Park in Tulsa OK and
immediately drive non-stop to St. Louis.  The custom cherry
red Datson 510 has no problem with the drive. 
You crash on your sister's pull-out couch but can't sleep.
You're too excited.

Your day is a hazy blur of sight and sound.  The people are as
deep as the sea.  In your fog you
witness performances by:

Orbital,
Devo,
The Prodigy,
The Orb,
Snoop Dog with Tupac,
and the closing act, Tool

Afterwards, you find yourself [holding the door](../../hold_the_door/hodor.md)
