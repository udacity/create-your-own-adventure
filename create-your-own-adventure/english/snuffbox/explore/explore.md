After the titanic sneeze rocked baseball sized holes in the marshmallow walls surrounding you. 
A curious thought enters your head.
"I wonder what is in them?" you ask yourself.
Cautiously you approach one of them and slowly reach out towards the nearest hole. 
The sweat on your brow is telling you that this is how people lose arms in horror stories, but you press on.
 As you hand slides into the snot created hole you feel the slime on your arm and suddenly you AWAKE! 
 BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!
 Your alarm is blaring and you realize you have drooled all over your bed again!
