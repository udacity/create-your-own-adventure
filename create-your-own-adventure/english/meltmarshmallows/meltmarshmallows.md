You conjure up a flamethrower, and the sadistic side of you comes out.
You begin melting the marshmallow walls, and the screams of the marshmallows
bring you this feeling of intense joy that you cannot explain.
As you step out of the hole you've produced, a great idea sparks you:
"What if I melt ALL these marshmallows for my smores?? :)"
