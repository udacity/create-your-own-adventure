[Argentine tango](../tango/tango.md)

ballet:

You dance frantically until the ground begins to shake and 
then marshmallows fall from walls revealing a hidden door.

Gather the marshmallows and enter through the hidden door into the magic, marshmallow kitchen.

Let us bake

The cake is ready to bake. 

But there are too many cooks!

Or so you think. You're not sure because you are self-aware of your tendency to be 
easily swayed by catchy rock songs of the 80s and Foreigner - Double Vision was just on the radio.

You become other aware that a potential dance partner is making eye contact with you...

Just get to sleep

Dance Like MJ , live you life fully, 

Now you should dance at least an hour a day.
