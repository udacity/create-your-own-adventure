Want to know some of Swami Vivekananda's teachings? [Refer this](teachings-of-swami-vivekananda/quotes.md)

All the best with whatever you wish to do in your life :)

But, whatever you do, don't touch a hot stove.

But, whatever you do, don't use the toaster in the bath tub ...

But, whatever you do, don't talk about your favorite type of "Bath Bomb" or
the best "Photo Bomb" you have seen in the airport security line ...

But, whatever you do, be curious...

But, whatever you do, do things that you're afraid of...

Do what you love.
