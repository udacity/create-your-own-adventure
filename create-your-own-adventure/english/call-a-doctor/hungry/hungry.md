"But I'm so hungry that the walls are turning to marshmallows!" you say to the doctor.

"Marshmallows, huh?" He scribbles something on a page in a folder thick with

you thought there was an image of St. Stephen in your meatloaf." The doctor 
rubs his eyes, radiating disappointment.

"I'm sorry," the doctor says. "Dr. Sakamoto will be here later on for another round 
of shock treatments."

"What? More shock treatments? I can't take those.. I am scared!" you say to the doctor.

"Well, we dont have a choice. Do we? You are seeing marshmallow walls for heavens sake" the doctor says.
