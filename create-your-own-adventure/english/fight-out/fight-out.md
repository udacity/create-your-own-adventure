You don't want the story.

But the thrill is just [outside](../marshmallow.md) your door.

It's just waiting there with tons of stories.

but it seems you have chosen your path.

You can go now, wake up with a litle [memory of this story in your life](../memories/memories.md).

or you can still make your own [destiny](../destiny/destiny.md).

And step out to the light side.
