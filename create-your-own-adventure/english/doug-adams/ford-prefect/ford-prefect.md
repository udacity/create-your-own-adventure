The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book,
perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out
of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor.
More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE
THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's
trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S
GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD PERSON, ANYWAY?
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy,
the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia
Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it
has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly
inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.
First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has the words ["DON'T PANIC"](../../alchemy/alchemy.md) printed in
large friendly letters on its cover.
