Three massive dragons appear.
You know you have seen them somewhere. You try to recall where..
Where did I see these dragons ?
Where... Where....Where

The mushroom walls have a smirk on their face..
They know the answer and they also know that you don't have much time to think...

The walls are getting closer...

Suddenly you remember... These are the [dragons](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dragons) of the 
Khaleesi from the Game Of Thrones

You feel fortunate that you had taken time out and learned a few 
[Valyrian](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/High_Valyrian) words...

Who knew that one day you will have to use Valyrian tongue for survival...

'Dracarys' - you shout out as loud as you probably can...

The biggest of the dragon - [Drogon](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Drogon) - stares at you with his 
big eyes...

You wonder if he understood the situation...

He comes closer and bends....You realize that he is asking you to ride on him...You hop on without any 
delay...

He looks around his siblings Viserion and Rhaegal...they all understand the need of the hour.......all 
three take a deep breath....

And then there is fire everywhere... A fire the likes of which you have never seen before in your entire 
life... 

The mushroom walls start melting rapidly... they are cursing you as they know their death is close...

The wall on your left melts completely and you now see a way out of this mushroom jungle...and signal 
Drogon to fly...

You do not much energy left in you...You are extremely tired...You don't even realize when you 
fell asleep...

When you wake up its noon and you come to know that it was all a dream !
