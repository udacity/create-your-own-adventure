Excited, you greedily stuff the first blueberry pancake in your mouth and realize that
the blueberry doesn't quite taste like blueberry. It tastes like something oddly
familiar, but you can't quite put your finger on it. Your buddy looks at you and his
smile starts to fade.

"Are you okay, dude?" he asks.

You don't answer because you are terrified by the knowledge of what you hoped could
not be true. You realize that the blueberry pancakes actually taste like...
marshmallows! In fact, you don't even watch Emeril. You don't even recognize the person 
sitting across the table.

You wake up and realize that you were merely in a marshmallow coma. You curse the guy
that wrote the movie, "Inception" and wonder how your own autobiography could be so
predictable.

Sitting up, you ponder what to do next.
