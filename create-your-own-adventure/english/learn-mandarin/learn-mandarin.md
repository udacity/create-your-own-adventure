I love you in Mandarin is 我(wo)爱(ai)你(ni). It sounds like 
"Wha(t) I nee(d)" without the sounds in braces.
Hello in Mandarin is 你(ni)好(hao), it sounds like 'knee how'.
Roughly translated it means 'You Good'. 
Adding 吗(ma) at the end, turns it into a question but only 
do that if you know the person really well.
