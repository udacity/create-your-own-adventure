You retreive your cellphone from your pocket to use as a
source of light. You then walk back the way you came. On your
way back you accidentally walk into a wall. You wonder why you don't remember seeing it there earlier. Upon closer
examination, you realize that the "wall" is in fact the hind
leg of an enormous dragon.
