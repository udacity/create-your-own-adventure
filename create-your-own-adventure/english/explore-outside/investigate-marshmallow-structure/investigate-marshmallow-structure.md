The marshmallow room you've just eaten your way out of is only one wing of an enormous marshmallow palace.
You can see strange green people through a third story window. 
All the other windows are dark in a scary tone of black.
They seem to be dancing around a wooden table.

Do you:

[Say hello?](./say-hello/say-hello/say-hello.md)

[Go join in their dance?](./say-hello/join-dance/join-dance.md)

[Explore the other wings of the palace?](./say-hello/explore-other-wings/explore-other-wings.md)

[Find the smallest room in the palace?](./small-room/small-room.md)

[Look for a light switch to see what's behind the other windows?](./light-switch/light-switch.md)

[Walk up and greet the green people?](./greet-green/greet-green.md)
