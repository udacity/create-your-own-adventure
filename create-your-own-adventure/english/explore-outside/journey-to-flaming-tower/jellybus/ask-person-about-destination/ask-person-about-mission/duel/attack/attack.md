You charge the roaring KitKat. His huge, wafer body sits atop two thin pretzel legs. He is top heavy. You decide to 
knock him off balance, but he lunges forward and catches you mid-stride. You fly face first into his chocolatey belly.
You try to push away. Your fingers are sticky with fluff from the marshmallow room. The KitKat pushes his weight on top
of you, and pins you to the ground. You feel your lungs collapse. The few small breaths you manage are filled with the 
scent of milk-chocolatey goodness. The heat of your body begins to slowly melt the KitKat's exterior. The liquid 
chocolate mixes with the marshmallow stuck between your fingers. 

Your stomach grumbles.
