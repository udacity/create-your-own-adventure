Bracing yourself for the impact, you quickly reverse your momentum, throwing
your right shoulder back towards whatever is pursuing you. As you collide with
the pursuer, you find yourself suddenly grateful for all those times your older
sister did this to you when hiking just ahead of you on a trail. Shards of
gingerbread fly past you as your shoulder shatters the cookie creature. Its head
whirls through the air, a frown on its face.

Its last words before it breaks upon the rock-candy ground are, "I can't catch
you, I'm the Gingerbread Man."
