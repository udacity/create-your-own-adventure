While walking home you stumbled upon a field of strawberries. 
Not any ordinary strawberries, talking ones.

The strawberries are actually talking hurriedly about something in their midst, 
pointing with extended leaves at a small object. 
It is white, with red spots the size of silver dollars.
Strangely, it is about the size of the A.W.E. Striker w/ Crankcase from 
G.I. Joe Attack on Cobra Island series.

You feel oddly happy seeing all this.
