You manage to scream for the entire 11 seconds it takes to 
fall to the ground. The little red fellow seems to be muttering
something, but you can't hear anything over the sound of your
own screaming. You don't notice when he disappears. Your 
broken body is soon burnt to a crisp beside the flaming tower. 
Better use your wits next time.
