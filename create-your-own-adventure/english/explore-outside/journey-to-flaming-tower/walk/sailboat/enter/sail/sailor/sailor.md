Gently, but quickly, you shake the sailor awake. There is no time to explain, but from your frantic gesticulating he senses something is
wrong. Whilst wiping the sleep from his eyes with one hand, he uses the other to grab the rudder and deftly steers the boat to the shore.

The sailor stares at you with angry eyes. 
"You had better tell me EXACTLY what YOU are doing in MY boat!"
