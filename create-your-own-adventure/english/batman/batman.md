But I know what you're wondering. If Bruch Wayne is the Bat, then who is Bruce Wayne? Well it's obvious...

...IT'S JOHN CENA!!!

And that's why both Batman and John Cena's theme songs always seem familiar even if you've never heard them before!

but you wonder does it end [here?](../movie-ripoffs/selfaware/selfaware.md)

But then you realized that Bruce Wayne is really John Travolta from Face Off! Holy toledo! You jump up and down at
this realization, then you go:

[tell papa-louie and he says...](../papa-louie/papa-louie.md)

Bruce Wayne: It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.

Commissioner Gordon: He's the hero Gotham deserves but not the one that it needs right now.
