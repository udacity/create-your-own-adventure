Your hungry and tired, pizza is the only thing that will cheer you up.
But you dont know what to order.
Suddenly a [menu](https://www.pizzahut.com.au/) appears!

You thought long and hard about fried chicken, or perhaps all you can eat
mongolian stir fry but in the end the only thing that truly matters to a
programmer is hot delivery pizza. When it's done you'll hang it from your window
in a pillowcase to keep it cold and hidden from the horrible people that are
after you.

Pineapple however makes everything better.

Another option also appears a [menu](http://fongspizza.com/) for Fong's pizza.

Fong's serves delicious Asian Pizza and also offers exceptional
[Tiki Drinks](http://liquor.com/slideshows/10-tiki-cocktails-to-kick-off-summer/).

Add bacon to your pizza. Bacon makes everything taste better.
