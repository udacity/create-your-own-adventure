You recently read that meditation helps you feel more awake, relieves stress, and helps you prepare for the day ahead.

You then whip out your iPhone to open up the Headspace meditation app.

So you begin to meditate for 30 minutes and when you finish, you feel more refreshed than ever.

The vision of dancing women flying from cloud to cloud are magical.

You decide to meditate more.  You meditate for 60 minutes and when you finish you feel agitated.

Now the dancing women have been replaced by clowns.

Clearing your mind and observing your thought, now your are more focused and ready to take on the day.

Meditation also develops positive emotion and helps to see the world in different perspective.

Daily meditation practice helps in long time. 

And you feel like you need to do something, but what ...
