The Marshmallow creature has a look of determination as it lunges toward you.

	"This is almost irresistible. Your so deliciously low...so horribly cute. 
	I shall make a duchess-uh, duke?- of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe."
The Marshmallow crossbreed stops dead in its tracks. It looks around, 
not quite sure if your talking to it or someone else in the fluffy room.

	"Yes in six months...three, if it has a good ear and quick tongue...
	I'll take it anywhere and pass it off as anything! 
	We start today, now, this minute!"
The Marshmallow beast sees you frantically moving about, excited by the new
challenge! Ah, if only Higgins were here to see this great endeavor! 
No matter! When you see him, you'll tell him the struggle, the tears 
(not yours of course), the near insanity of it all! Oh how much well-deserved 
praise you shall get! And dearest Eliza will...will get you your slippers!
Unknowingly to you, the marshmallow animal is confused, and in its confusion 
it begins to get angry. Angry that it cannot understand the excitement 
this wonderful and majestic being is exuding. It again tries to catch 
your attention by charging towards you!

	"Before I'm done with it, the streets will be strewn with bodies of men, 
	or women, shooting themselves for your sake-What in the devil?!"
Just as the fluffy being is going to close in on you, you put your cane 
(given by the king, who attended the party you hosted a fortnight ago, 
quite the buzz it was for days after!) on its pillowy chest and stop it.

"Look here, you are no use to anybody but me, so do as I say! In fact, 
I should teach you a lesson for such impudence!"
WHACK.
WHACK, WHACK.

	"I've hit you, you infamous creature! You deserve more than three 
	slaps for causing me to lose my temper. A thing that has hardly ever 
	happen to me before. I prefer to say nothing more tonight. 
	I shall go to bed."
Dumbfounded, the Marshmallow thinga-ma-bob holds its face where you hit 
it and watches you climb into its bed.
Impudence!
