Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a modern 
city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. It lies 
off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 
kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator; it is also separated 
from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, 
and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait 
to the south. Singapore's territory consists of the 
diamond-shaped main island, commonly referred to as Singapore Island 
in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 
significantly smaller islets; also, land reclamation has been used 
to expand Singapore's land area, which is highly urbanised.
