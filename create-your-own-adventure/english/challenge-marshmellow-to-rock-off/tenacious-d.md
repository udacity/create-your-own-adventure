Realizing now that the marshmallows have become self-aware, much unlike SkyNet, 
your jacket reacts to these sentient beings and springs to life almost destroying 
your skin in the process. The jacket now forms a leather mouth, through which you 
hear the sound of none other than Ronnie James Dio, the guitar legend.
He is old, wrinkled, shriveled and decrepit, but still holds within him the mighty
power of rock.

" I heard you brave young Jacket-guy, you are hungry for the rock 
But to learn the ancient methods, secret doors you must unlock 
Escape your father's clutches in this oppressive neighborhood 
On a journey you must go to find the land of Hollywood 
In the City of Fallen Angels, where the ocean meets the sand 
You will form a strong alliance and the world's most awesome band 
To find your fame and fortune, through the valley you must walk 
You will face your inner demons, now go my son and ROCK!"

As the epic monologue ends, you realize that the lighter and fork and rope 
you hold must be in some way related to the cryptic message that Dio said.
As you ponder this, you realize the marshmallows are still awestruck by Dio's 
awesomeness. You take this chance to craft a makeshift Fire whip by burning the 
rope and tying it to the fork and whiplashing around you like Indiana Jones and 
harge through the weak wall of Marshmallows.

As you scurry forward screaming your battle cry in sync to Dio's vocals, you see 
a small wooden door directly ahead of you saying "Keep Out" in faded lettering. 
To your immediate right, a dim light shines not far from your current position, 
as you gleam towards it while darting towards the door, you arrive at a tiny 
(proverbial) fork in the road, will you:

[Go towards the light?](light-route/joker.md)

[Rush towards the door?](castle-route/narnia.md)
