You push the button for up and the elevator carries you higher. Eventually it stops and an old woman welcomes you in.
"Hello" She says. "I'm glad it was you that made all the right choices."
She hands you an envelope. Inside you find the keys to a safe deposit box with the word "Solutions" written on it. 
"This has all the answers you are looking for." She says as she guides you back to the elevator.
