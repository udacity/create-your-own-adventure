You suddenly remember that you always keep a small package of Tums
just in case you end up eating large amounts of the walls of a room.
Now the only challenge is to ingest two of the pink cylinders - 
you always struggle with this since you hate how they leave a 
chalky residue. Thinking of it alone makes you gag, so once you 
decide to pop two Tums, you swallow them right away without chewing 
to avoid this. 

The Tums are now working their magic and you are starting to feel better.
