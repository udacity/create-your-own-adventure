you suspect the marshmallows are evil. 
they would like to snatch your lighter rope and fork and tie you the stake poke and burn you.
you react fast and hide all the three in your pocket. 
next you grab a handful of marshmallows from the wall and stuff you mouth with them.
but then they are quickly replaced. 
you guess you cant eat them all but no harm trying isn't it..
You hear a voice creeping from behind you....
and you realise there is no better place you could be right now than right here.

Fear grips you and your brain start to whirl with ideas.
