The twinkle bursts into flashes of memory that assemble your senses into a perception
of where you are. Tendrils of deja-vu tug at your mind reel your conscienceness to the disturbing truth. 
This looks like the padded cell from a movie or television show.

Another tug, this time on your arm, turns into a sharp pain of an needle snaking back to
an IV bag. 

Footsteps grow louder, then faster. The room starts to fade. Voices. Darkness.
