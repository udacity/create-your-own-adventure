I cant eat it alone, lets call mom and share with her.

Mom, however, does not like marshmallows and thinks you are going to spoil your dinner.
 She also unfortunately does not believe your story about the marshmallows coming alive!

But Mother was never to be trusted. 
In fact, you always thought she was hiding something. 
She always stared at the Michillan Man just a bit too long..

...remember Mom, the Michelin Man needs time to heal! All of 
“time” is counting on him. I like this Michelin Man, a new 
Michelin Man is a new Michelin Man--we don’t want that do we?
