You stare intently at the bulbous figure lying before you as it  spends 
its last moments of life grimacing in pain. You hear a familiar voice 
coming from the blob as it mutters something unintelligible. You get as 
close to the blob as you can without touching it, hoping to figure out that 
familiar voice. You lean in too close and brush your elbow against the blob. 
Immediately, the gooey marshmallow substance begins to inch up your arm as 
you stare in horror. In the background you hear, 
"He never saw it coming. But his wife did."
