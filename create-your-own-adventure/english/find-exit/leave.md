You feel the walls until you find the jell-o door.

Excited for the day ahead of you, you walk through it to go to work.

There are two paths outside. One leads into a forest. One leads into the mountains.

In the distance, you notice a tower that has caught fire, but is smoking a deep shade of purple.

You then notice a purple haze is that of burning mushrooms. You start to feel queasy and disoriented.

Overhead, you hear a loud, running noise. It's a chococopter!

You have a slight cold.  You might want to call in sick to work. What do you do?

I would run to the forest

The forest turns dark. I don't see the ice-cold water and fall into it.
