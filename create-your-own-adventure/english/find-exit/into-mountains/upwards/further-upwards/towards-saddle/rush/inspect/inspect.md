You recognize the figurine as a rare magical item: an Aspect of the Ursine Mother. This Aspect must have
been a gift from the Bear Goddess herself to reward you for your bravery.

You remember a ritual you learned of as a child whereby an Aspect may be burned to release its
blessing upon the owner.

Do you attempt the ritual?
