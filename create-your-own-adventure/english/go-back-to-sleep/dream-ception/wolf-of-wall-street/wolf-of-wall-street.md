You wake up at the sound of money and take a bite of a 100$ marshmallow bill sitting on your face. 
You stand up and hear distant laughter. You are in a room full of people listening to Leo. Silence
then. Everybody turns around, watching him as he paces to the back of the room, where you are 
standing. He stops and then suddenly throws you a white cilinder.

 "Sell me this marshmallow!"
