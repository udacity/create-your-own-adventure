The Marshmallow Titanic is rapidly shattering, and you are falling into the water. The straitjacket 
is tight, preventing you from making any movement. Just before you reach the water surface, sand 
starts to rise from the ocean, forming an island. Your landing is soft. You realize that the island 
is actually a giant marshmallow!

Standing in front of you is Leo, dressed in his detective suit, the badge shining from his belt.
But something feels wrong. 

Leo slowly raises his face towards you, and with a look of terror in his eyes, he exclaims:

"We gotta get off this marshmallow, Chuck!"
