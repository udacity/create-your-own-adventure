His hair is disarrayed, and he smells vaguely like motor oil.

"You are not safe here," he says.

"Why not?" I ask.

"You've entered a parallel universe of sorts, where things are strangely similar to films, I've starred in," he answers.

Leo continues, "Here, you're on board a marshmallow version of the *Titanic!*
I've been in the engine room trying to make some adjustments to the motors..."

"And here", he says, as the marshmallow walls close in and wrap around you like a straitjacket,
"you are on an island, [shutter...](./shutter-island/shutter-island.md)!"

"But wait, there's more!" he shouts. The straitjacket is gone and money falls from the ceiling.
Marshmallow bills and coins are softly hitting your head. 
You start to feel [dizzy](./wolf-of-wall-street/wolf-of-wall-street.md).

"Hello, are you with me?" asks Leo. You find yourself sitting in the enigne room just as before. 
"The motors are unstable, I've been trying to make some adjustments but to no avail. Get out of 
here, you are not safe!"

Do you [ignore](../../warning-ignore/ignore.md) or 

[listen to] (../../warning-heed/heed.md) his warning?
