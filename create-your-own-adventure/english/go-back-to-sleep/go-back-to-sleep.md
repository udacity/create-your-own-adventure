The marshmallow floor is soft, and thankfully not very sticky.

It's super weird that there is a marshmallow floor whether you're awake or you're dreaming. Maybe you're always
dreaming?

You roll over, let your eyes close shut, and drift off into [dreamland](../dream/dream.md)

You wonder, idly, what happens if you start dreaming from within a dream..

When suddenly you are face to face with [Leonardo DiCaprio](./dream-ception/dream-ception.md)

You want to say something to him but you draw a blank.

The only movie you can think of that he was in is "Basketball Diaries".

So you just smile and keep going.

But suddenly, you're on a boat. A huge boat. A [doomed](./imflying/titanic.md) boat?
