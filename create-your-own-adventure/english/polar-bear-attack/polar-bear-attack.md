You leap and jump on the back of the polar bear. It bucks and tries to throw
you off but fortunately your experience as an amateur bull-riding champion
stands you in good stead. You tame the wild beast and charge at the 
marshmallow barrier before you. The polar bear rips and tears at your pink
and white squishy prison. Eventually you emerge in and entirely new place...
Now you are riding a polar bear covered in delicious pink marshmallow.  But 
wait, there are bees...
