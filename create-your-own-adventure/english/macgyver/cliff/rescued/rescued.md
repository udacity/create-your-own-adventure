You lose sight of her as you spin and hurtle head first towards the abyss.
All of a sudden you feel her catch you by the ankle 
and stop suddenly in the air. (She was always astoundingly strong.) 

She brings you both back to the cliff, 
where she drops you unceremoniously from a few good feet up 
(you were a jerk after all). 

Safe on solid ground again...
