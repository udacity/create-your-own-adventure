In a panic, you try to extinguish the fire before you succumb to smoke inhalation. 
Using the jacket, you attempt to smother the fire. The flames finally subside, but 
not before you have burned your hands. As you stare at your blistered hands in 
horror and agony, you barely notice that the smoke has been cleared from the room 
and replaced by fresh air. 

You can breathe, but your hands are burnt too severely to use them. The rope is burnt
beyond use, and your fingers cannot operate the lighter or grasp the fork.
