You've burned a small hole in the marshmallow ceiling. MacGyver would be proud.

Tearing at the hole, you make it large enough to escape, and pull yourself out
of the open hole. You stand on a ceiling of marshmallow and see the horrible truth.

Your whole town has turned to sentient marshmallow buildings.
People are trying to get free, escape anyway they can.

You reach back into your room and snatch the fork and rope before the marshmallow
hand returns. Placing the items in your pocket, you lower yourself down kicking
foot-holds in the outer wall.

Today will be trouble, but nothing more than a MacGyver like you can handle,
right?
