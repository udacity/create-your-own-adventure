As you look, you realize the colored lights from the GumDrop mountain are
coming closer. 

They swoop down in magnificent rainbow style and land directly at your feet.

Reaching out and touching the rainbow you see it's not actually light at all. It's more candy!

Wondering what the rainbow taste like, your desire overcomes any concerns about diabetes.

You lean forward, close your eyes, and lick across all the colors of the rainbow. 

Instead of the usual flavors they taste gross. 

Yellow taste like barf, and green taste like boogers.

You remember your past and feel ashamed you know what those taste like. 

You begin to cry uncontrollably.
