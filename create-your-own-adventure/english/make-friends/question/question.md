"Why, Mr. Marshmellow Man? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why, why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're

fighting... for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom?

Or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Marshmellow Man. Vagaries of perception. Temporary

constructs of a feeble marshmellow intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning

or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the marshmellow room itself, although... only a marshmellow mind could

invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Marshmellow Man. You must know it by now.

You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Marshmellow Man? Why? Why do you persist?"
