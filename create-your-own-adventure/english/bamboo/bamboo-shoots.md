at the top of the bamboo trees you meet a whole panda family, they are friendly.
they show you a path ahead out of the forest, which you take. As you venture deep into the forest
you start to realize these pandas may not be as friendly as you thought.

You turn around and the pandas all have evil grins.  They climb down from the
bamboo and walk towards you.

You don't know what to do.The pandas continue to walk towards you.

You begin retreating slowly.Suddenly,one of the pandas speed up.

How strong is scaffolding made of bamboo you ask?
