The polar bear looks hungry. Maybe i should give him this soft delicious marshmallow. 
Here you go polar bear. But he doesn’t move. Is he color blind? Maybe he doesn’t see white. 
So after waiting 10 minutes, i decide to just get my picture taken with him. No wait. 
I’m too far away, let me step of this fence. He grabs my tennis shoe and tries to eat it. He was hungry!

This polar bear must sleep with his eyes open!

You desperately try to pull your foot from the shoe, it gripped in teeth as 
white as marshmallows.

You manage to slip free, and you scramble away from the bear on your hands and 
knees.

When you look back, you see the polar bear nawing at the shoe like a big ol' 
dog!

For some reason, you forget your fear and watch. The polar bear eventually stops 
chewing away and looks up at you with big happy eyes and his tongue flopping out
of the side of his mouth.

The polar bear was distracted by the incredible herd/pod of walruses.
 These amazing animals are now viewable on youtube.. 
..(do a google search for live walrus feed)..
the walruses quickly help the situation by using their tusks to pierce any
marshmellows and create a rip in the fabric of reality.. you jump on the 
walruses back..

While riding the walrus you quickly pull the pin from the hand grenade you’ve been clenching.

You then toss the grenade in the general direction of the polar bear. 

The grenade explodes and causes the bear to lose a layer of skin.

Now you decide to:
