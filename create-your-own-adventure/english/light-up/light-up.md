Quick as lightning, you manage to duck the marshmallow hand.
And with the lighter, you light up one end of the rope and push the other end into the wall.

The hand reaches for you again. You gab for your leather 
coat and just in time you wrap it around the hand
and stick the sleeves into the softened marshmallow.
The hand is squirming to get free. One sleeve come free!

A hole starts to form near the burning rope. This is your 
chance to get free! The other sleeve has become free!
The had is squirming to get the coat off.
Hurry!

Do you:
