The heavy yellow mist that envelops your entire person begins to dissipate. 
In the distance, you recognize the looming towers of Nyarlathotep piercing
the heavens. They promised they would never lure you back to this place,
but the old ones have never been known to keep their promises.
Cthulhu, the eldritch terror, emerges through the haze.
Your brain spasms in abject horror. He says nothing, but your
choice is clear. Do you:

[Writhe] (writhe/writhe.md) in agony for ten thousand millenia

Accept instant death at the hands of the [Yog-Sothoth] (yogsothoth/yog-sothoth.md)

[Boil] (boil/boil.md) your own flesh with the heat of one million suns

All the while the call of cthulhu can be heard, ominously accompanying your fate

When will the old ones rise?
