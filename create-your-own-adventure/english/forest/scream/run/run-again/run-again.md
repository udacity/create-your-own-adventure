You get to your feet ignoring the pain in your right leg.

You hold the parachute behind you like a cape and run towards the tiger while
screaming at the top of your lungs.

The parachute inflates behind you and makes you appear several times larger than
you really are.

The tiger flinches as the larger you rushes towards him. He quickly twists his
body away from you and runs off.

You stop chasing the tiger.

You make a mental note never to scream for help in a forest again.

You decide your next move is to ...

[Drag yourself further into the woods.](../../../drag/drag.md)

[Try to gather materials for a signal fire.](../../../fire/fire.md)

[Check your pockets.](../../../pockets/pockets.md)

[Make a shelter from the parachute.](../../../shelter/shelter.md)

[Eat all of your rations in a panic.](../../../eat/eat.md)
