You grab a long sharp branch off the ground next to your fire. Bloodlust pulses
through your veins as you stalk the bear. You find him sitting next to a tree
stump digging honey out of a poor bees nest. Running at the bear, spear in hand,
you sink the sharp end into his back and the bear cries out in pain.

Victory achieved, you march triumphntly back to your camp.
