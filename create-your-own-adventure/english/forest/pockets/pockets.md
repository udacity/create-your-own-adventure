You thought about what you can do with what you have now.

You empty your pants pockets on the grass in front of you. A pocket knife, a
block of magnesium, a flare, a first aid kit and a machete. Now that's good
news!

You bandage your leg with supplies from the first aid kit and make a leg
splint out of two nearby branches and some of the remaining bandages.

It's getting darker. In the distance, you hear something. Could... Could it
be? Yes! It's a rescue helicopter! If only there was a way to signal them..

You light the flare and wave it over your head! Suddenly you realize, that
under all this thick foliage, there is no way they are able to see it... Of
course! You throw the flare at the tree that holds your parachute. Immediately,
the flare sets it ablaze! You hear the sounds of the helicopter's rotor blades
approaching. It lands in a small nearby field. You're saved! As you limp
towards the helicopter, and see stewardesses approach you with champagne and
refreshments, you think to yourself:

"Phew. That could have gone very differently!"
