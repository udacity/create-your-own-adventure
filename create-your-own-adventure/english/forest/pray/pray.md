You decide to pray to God.

You wisper out loud, "God, please save me!If you save me now I will go to church 
everyday...or at least every Sunday, whenever I am not too busy.Please God save 
me!!".

Then you suddenly a sound, Ssss....Sssss....Ssssss.....King Cobra about 
5 feet away from you.You quickly jump and start running in a zigzag way.You look 
back while running trying to spot if it is chasing you.Suddenly you trip on a rock 
and hit your head and lose consciousness.

You wake up to white curtains all around you.You try to figure out where you are 
and how did you there.Then you notice a silhouette of someone in a corner.You call 
out to him and ask, "Who are you? Where am I? How did I get here?"

He replies, "I am GOD.You are in safe heaven.You are Dead."
