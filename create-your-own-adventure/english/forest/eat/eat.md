In a panic, you stuff your face full of all the airplane 
pretzels and peanuts they gave you and slurp the last drop of
the Coke. There were exactly 12 peanuts and 7 pretzels. You
wonder if you should have rationed them out over the course
of a week or so, one pretzel and two peanuts per day. But 
it is too late, and you're still hungry.

You see a squirrel on a tree branch and wonder how much meat
is on it...
