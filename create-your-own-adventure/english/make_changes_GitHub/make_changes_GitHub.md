You suddenly realize that you are actually living in a bizarre, made up world created by the genius students
of Udacity's GitHub course. Since you are a well-respected software engineer in real life, you know Git and
GitHub like the back of your hand.

You take the wand and shouted a spell. "Huzzah!" Suddenly, your trusty MacBook Pro appeared on the floor.
You open it up and turn it on. For some reason, there's WiFi! Despite all of its horror, this marshmallow
nightmare is pretty well-equipped!

You open up Chrome and found Udacity's create-your-own-adventure GitHub page. You notice that you don't have a
local copy of the repository. Do you:

[Create a fork of the repository](create_fork/clone_repo.md)

[Clone the source repository](clone_source/stuck.md)

[Google what to do because you have no idea](google/die.md)

[Might be want to start againâ€¦](../marshmallow.md)
