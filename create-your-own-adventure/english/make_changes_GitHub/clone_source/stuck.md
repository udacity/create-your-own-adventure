You open up the command line and use Git to clone the repo to your computer. You begin making changes to the story
to get yourself out of this awful world. When you finish your changes, nothing happened.

Then a horrible realization came upon you: cloning the upstream repo doesn't allow  you to make any
contributions or changes to it. You should have forked it first! Panicked, you try to go back onto
the GitHub page to fork the repo, but the WiFi is out!!

You are forever stuck in this place...
