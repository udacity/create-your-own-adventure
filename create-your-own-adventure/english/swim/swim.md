Swim while sleeping is really cool but dangerous. You swam for 10 min and decided to give it up. 

But then you decided to try again, and jumped into the water whilst sleeping.

You realize you don't need to breathe, and water cannot get into your nose.

As you swim more, you rise to the surface and find yourself flying out of the water.
But you are not asleep anymore, and you now have super powers! Do you choose to
