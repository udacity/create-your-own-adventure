You decide to dance randomly. It seems like a good idea at the time.

You get jiggy with it.

You shake dem hips.

You laugh and laugh and laugh some more.

You catch yourself smiling, ever so brightly.

And oh yeah... how could you have forgotten?... life... it's beautiful!

It only makes sense that next, you...

Get inspired to finally do all those things you have been long contemplating...

Get that crazy haircut...change your look.

Quit that boring, unchallenging safe job and learn something new...
...don't feel ashamed to start at the bottom.

Learn that new language....

Take a 6 month break to just travel...meet new people...try new things.

Tell those who value - why they are such an important part of your life.

Thank those you take for granted...

Live the new life you just found with the wonder, enthusiasm and zeal of a 2 yr old...

Exactly like its supposed to be lived!!!
