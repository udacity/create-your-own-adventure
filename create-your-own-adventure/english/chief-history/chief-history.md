The Chief looks at you questionably.

"Well that's an interesting request..." he ponders.

He takes out two foldable chairs and unfolds them.
"Make yourself comfortable, I will tell you my tale."

As you listen to him tell his tale, you feelings both of desire
(for marshmallows and chocolate) and of revulsion (occasioned by
the thought of over-indulgence). You force yourself to concentrate,
and are treated to a surprising revelation:

You discover that the Marshmallow Chief earned his title through an
annual competition held throughout the Marshmallow Kingdom. Before
being bestowed with Marshmallow-y powers, he was just a normal
human. He attributes his success to his previous experience
as a U.S. Marine.

"Wow, that's fascinating. I would have never guessed that you
used to be human." You say.

However, there is still one more question lingering on the
tip of your tongue.

"But if what you say is true, then you must have had
a name before all of this. So what was your [name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am4oKAmc2To)?"
