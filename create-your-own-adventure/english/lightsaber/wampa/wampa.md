The Force is strong within you. You stretch out your hand 
and the lightsaber flies up into it. As you turn to stride away 
from the melting marshmallow mansion, you hear a blood-curdling roar.

You smell lilac and it reminds you of summering in the hamptons with
your good friends the Millers.  I wonder what they are up to now?

You run into something, and it's not just the cold.

You stumble over a small metalic box in the stubby grass.  Upon closer inspection, you find that
the roar is actually coming from this box.  It has some kind of proximity sensor that triggers it.
Now why would someone have left this lying here?
