Searching for oil fields is much better.

Given an MxN grid, and drilling results, write a program that can determine how many
oil fields are present.  Note: if oil is found in adjacent nodes, it is the same
field and should not be counted again.

Wait...you seem to remember something about a marshmallow.  Mmm...marshmallows...
