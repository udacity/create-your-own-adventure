You get a run up and charge at the door, it smashes open you're outside, you pause
and look right and one of them sees you, you scream and turn left and scream some more

rear-view mirror at the carnage behind you, but you're safe, for now.

You pause on the side of the road until the ground begins to quake. You look in your rear
view mirror and notice a marshmellow Godzilla approaching.

In the RV, you notice only campground kits for making fires and smores.
