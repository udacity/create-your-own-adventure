You get close to the door and look through the keyhole,
and see daylight and people in huge numbers running,
then you see why they're running... Hoards of marshmallow 
creatures are chasing them. As one person gets taken down by this
marshmallow monster, you look on in horror as about 
twelve seconds pass. The man gets up however he is no longer human,
he's turned into a marshmallow man, you are 
scared then realize you need to make a choice.
