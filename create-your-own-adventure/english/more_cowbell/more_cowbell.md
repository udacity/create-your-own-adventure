A wild [Christopher Walken](http://www.hulu.com/watch/536145) appears!

He has a [pocket watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFtHjV4c4uw) in his hand, he begins to tell you about the watch

He also hands you a [weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCDIYvFmgW8)

He doesn't care about time or weapons though. 
He wants to become a man that trancends the current reality. 
One that feels time as though it is water and weapons as though they are air.
