There are also two "Emergency contact" options on the back of the card which read as follows

1) To speak to a superhuman: close eyes, cross thumbs and whisper "Shuman. Help. Me. Now."
2) To order pizza: cross eyes, close mouth and hum "Pizza. Me. Up."

After some discussion, Keith tells you that he'd prefer to see someone before Monday "just to be on the safe side". 
One of the emergency contacts seems like a good idea under the circumstances.

Do you choose 

[Option 1](./speak-superhuman/super-human.md) 

or 

[Option 2](../../../pizza/pizza.md)?
