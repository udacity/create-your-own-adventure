You board the next train heading to Mount Fuji, and arrive much faster than 
expected.  As you arrive at the entrance, it occurs to you that such a 
popular destination is strangely empty of visitors.  You approach the 
first gate, and realize that the statue of a 3-tailed fox beside it is 
not a statue at all, but alive.  The fox greets you, and asks whether 
you would be so kind as to donate 1,000 yen toward the UNESCO world 
heritage site.  Something about its tone and expression make you 
suspicious of what might happen should you proceed without making a donation.
