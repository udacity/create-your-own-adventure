What a good idea. The best thing to test if this is a dream is to try and fly!
Since flying is impossible in reality (and it sure is fun to do if this is a dream).

You start to bounce up and down on the marshmallow floor, flapping your little arms
as hard as you can. You really should have gone to the gym more. You feel a bit pathetic!

But is it just your imagination or are you getting higher with every bounce?

Hold on a minute there is a trapdoor in the ceiling.

You bounce a little higher and fly through the trapdoor. Still not quite sure if
this is a dream. But now you're just rolling with it!

Where do you go?
