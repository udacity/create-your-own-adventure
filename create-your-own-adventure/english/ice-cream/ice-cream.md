Yes, ice cream makes everything better.  Now it's just a matter of what flavor to have.  
There are so many delicious possibilities....

brown sugar oatmeal is surprisingly scumptious

I was here, read a few lines, ate some cookies and cream ice-cream, and read a few more lines.

All this reading about delicious adventures made me hungry so I ate some more ice-cream.
