Turns out that your humble servant is a huge mech 
robot with a giant drill equipped! Good work 
assembling that robot before. 
"My drill is the drill, that creates the HEAVENS", 
your humble servant shouts, and then it 
pierces through the marshmallow wall into the stratosphere.
As you fly through the heavens, you hear a small voice 
far in the distance: "Save me Bro!Please don't leave me!"
