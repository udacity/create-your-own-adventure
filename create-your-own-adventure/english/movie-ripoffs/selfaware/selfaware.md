The wand falls from your hand as suddenly you realize you can see the code.

You parry and block Morpheus's incoming blows with ease and land a kick on
his chest that sends him flying into the wall.

He staggers to his feet looking at you with sheer terror.

You run straight at him and jump headlong into his chest.  Once inside his
program, you delete his system32 file which causes him to explode into a
thousand tiny fragments.

Once you are reassembled, you notice irregularities in the code you see
spilling all around you.

You realize you are actually trapped within a collaborative coding program,
at the mercy of people who until recently didn't know what mkdir did.

You try to delete yourself, but the creator, realizing you are trying to escape,
stops you and conscripts you into administrative duty on McAfee for the rest of
your life.

But you realize you know lisp and therefore can devise a means of escape.
