Morpheus reels back as the symphony begins to sound. He
understands the consequences of your actions even if you
do not yet. One by one, the brooms march on, carrying
their buckets of water. Alone, each one would be a laughable
sight. Combined, however, their mass rocks the dojo and alarms
the nearby wildlife.

You dash out of the dojo to the relative safety of the
mountains in the distance. Slowly but surely, the brooms
follow, hauling the great sloshing payload. Realizing that
you need a better strategy, you bother the local coven of
witches at their mountaintop oasis. Word travels swiftly
in this virtual world, and you have heard much about their
magic-suppressing ring. You intend to use the ring to immobilize
the brooms and prevent more from spawning. Meanwhile, you spill
some dust in your path to temporarily distract the brooms.

Though initially reluctant to part with their ring, the witches
are shameless flirts. Using your most potent wiles, you effectively
seduce them. Despite a struggle, you manage to pry the ring
from their pleasure-clenched fingers. With one triumphant motion,
you secure the ring about the wand. As the music softly dies, you
feel the mountain shake as 10000 inanimate brooms collapse under
weight of their buckets of water.

Conveniently, your bucket-supplied deluge puts out a massive
forest fire. You are lauded as a virtual hero, and you enjoy
many virtual years (actual hours) of escapades before you emerge
an experienced king, an accomplished scholar, and a weathered
warrior. The real world has no idea what it's in for.
