As you approach the shaggy haired hippy, it is immediately obvious that the fellow is "high as a kite",
his eyes unsuccessfully attempting to focus on you as he inhales deeply from a half smoked joint.

"Who are you, and what the hell is this place?" you ask loudly, hoping to penetrate his drug-fogged stupor.

"Chill Bro - you're ruining the vibe!" whines the stoner.  "I'm Hansel by the way." he adds, waving vaguely.

"Where am I, and how do I get out of here?" you ask the red-eyed derelict, with a sense of increasing futility.

"Dude, that's awesome!" Hansel responds wide-eyed.  "You're lost! I'm lost! We're like cosmic twins or something!".

"But how did you get here?" you demand irritably, attempting to keep the conversation on track.

Looking puzzled Hansel continues. "Dunno. I was climbing Mt Vesuvius and I slipped and fell. Next thing I was here."
He pauses for a moment "Oh... epiphany... I've never even BEEN to Vesuvius!  Must be something to do with the pills." 

Excitedly, Hansel rummages through his pockets and hauls out a grubby assortment of colored tablets.  

"This dude, I think his name was Neon, sold me these.  He said the blue ones are for waking up, 
and the red ones are for ... ummm ... not waking up?  Or maybe the other way around?  Anyhow - you wanna try?".

Hansel holds out the pills, which look suspiciously like M&Ms to you.  Do you:
