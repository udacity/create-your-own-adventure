Your wand gives off a lurid Hollywood special effect, and Morpheus slumps to the ground, lifeless.

The walls of the dojo dissolve and you find yourself back in the sewers, surrounded by the same badly clothed
derelicts as before.  Some of them are clustered around the body of Morpheus, trying desperately to revive him.

It suddenly occurs to you that living in the smelly sewers with no services, amenities, retail stores, entertainment etc
 might not be such a great future.  Perhaps you should've taken the blue pill.
