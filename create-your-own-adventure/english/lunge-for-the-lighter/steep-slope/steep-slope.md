Against your better judgment--what's left of it at any rate--you make a mad
dash for the opening with the steep downward slope. Something about the whole
situation reeks of deception, and you have a vague recollection that you've seen
this opening before...while being chased by marshmallow men who were shooting
lasers. As you approach the opening, you see that the slope is much steeper than
it first appeared, and you can't see where it leads. Just then, you notice a
big red button above the opening.
