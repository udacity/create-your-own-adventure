With your first step into the hallway, you realize that the situation is about to become much more serious than you 
had ever feared. You gave the first picture a once-over, and you can see that it is an image of a very intelligent
creature that, if you didn't know that dinosaurs were extinct, you would swear was the result of millions of years
of further evolution of raptor type dinosaurs. The image depicted what you interpret as a "hunt" with the "hunter",
the primary subject of the image, using a long, three-bladed weapon to kill an immense bear-like animal. A panic
begins to swell within you.
