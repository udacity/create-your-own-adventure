You run up the staircase hoping to find some solace and a chance to catch your 
breath. You reach the top and to your relief find your feet land on a 
reassuringly solid parquet floor. You pause to pick clumps of marshmallow from 
the tread in your boots and contemplate your new situation. You find yourself 
looking around and realise that you're now standing in the living room of a 
penthouse apartment. On the wall, hangs a picture of a man with a mullet 
sporting a pair of aviators, and next to it hangs a calendar reading "31st 
December 1985". Ahead of you there is a corridor lined with a series of white 
marble sculptures. To your right you notice a fluttering curtain and see that 
the roof terrace door is slightly ajar. You pick up a Mars Bar laying that's on 
the coffee table, peel open the wrapper and decisively bite the end of the bar, 
covering for your indecision over which direction to explore.
