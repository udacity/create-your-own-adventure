Rembering how Captain Kirk confused an opponent by explaining the rules of Fizzbin
you begin to explain the game to the marshmallow hand.

"The game can be played with a standard deck of cards. Each player gets six cards,
except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven."

The marshmallow hand is listening intently so you continue.

"The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays. Two jacks are a 'half-fizzbin'."

The marshmallow hand is paying attention but is starting to stagger a bit. 

"If you have a half-fizzbin: a third jack is a 'shralk' and results in disqualification; 
one wants a king and a deuce, except at night, when one wants a queen and a four;  if a
king had been dealt, the player would get another card, except when it is dark, in which
case he'd have to give it back."

The marshmallow hand seems to be having difficulty staying upright.

"The top hand is a 'royal fizzbin', but the odds against getting one are said to be 
astronomical".

The marshmallow hand can take no more and falls down in a stupor.
