Although you're starting to get a bit-panicky, you remember that you wasted 5 and a half
hours last night watching Periscope when you should have been working on your iOS nanodegree.
You think to yourself, there must have been something I watched that was useful, I know 
I learned a tatic or two to deal with a marshmallow monster. You quickly come to your
senses, and remember that Periscope was a bunch of self-promotion and very little content.
Things are not looking good!
