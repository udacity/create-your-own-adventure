I really have no idea what's going on or what I'm supposed to be doing. 
I forked the repositroy
I cloned it
I created a branch
I created a new folder and file within it (this one)
I'm now going to try commit these changes and send a pull request - hopefully
Hey! You got this! You are now ready to help people build open-source software!
AWESOME!
