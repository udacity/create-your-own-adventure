	The pixie was approximately 6 inches tall and slender.  Even a small pigeon would 
be about twice her size in every direction. Her white, faintly glowing skin
would have made her difficult to see against the marshmallow walls if it
were not for her sky blue tunic.

	She looks to be the only other sentient being in the room and so you decide 
to talk to her.  You approach slowly because she looks frightened and because with
you luck she might not be as gentle as she looks.

	Once close enough you sit down and aske her, "Do these strange walls frighten you?"

	With a confused expression she appears to drop her guard to ask, "Why should they? 
What is so strange about them."

	Shocked, all you can think to yourself is 'Because they are strange! And surely 
marshmallow walls are no normal to you!?'
