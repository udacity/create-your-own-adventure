Sitting up on the floor with a familiar confused drowsiness you look around.
"Turtles?  Why are there turtles everywhere?  And why are they all starring at me?", you mumble.
"Because you came crashing down here all huge and green yelling HULK SMASK!  That's why!", replies one.  
"Now, would you like to get dressed or are you comfortable with those ripped up rags you have on?"
