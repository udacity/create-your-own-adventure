A man walks through the door a second after you get into
your hiding spot, you get ready to strike him on the head
and when you pounce from your position a big furry hand
grabs you from behind.

"Eject him out the airlock, Chewy" the man says.

"Eeeeggghhhhaaaaaeeeeeaaaggh" replies the furry handed creature.

You're brought to the closest airlock, tossed inside and as 
the inner door closes you regret not checking the ship
before flying away on it.
