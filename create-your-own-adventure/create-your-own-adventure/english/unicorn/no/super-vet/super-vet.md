You pull the vets business card from your pocket and hold it outstreched in your hand to Keith. 
The unicorn gives you an angry look and you're not sure if it's because you've been too forward 
about his health or that he doesn't have hands with which to take the card.

You nearly admit that this whole time you have been thinking about riding him like a bucking 
bronco.  Like in [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiHXnSkP6Qw) cowboy video you saw 
this morning.  But just in case he can't read your mind; you make a 
different choice.
