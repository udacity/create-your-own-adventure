You hear a buzzing noise followed by two clicks.  The hairs on your skin start to stand on end.  A light breeze seems 
to appear from nowhere, bringing with it an aroma that you can't quite place.  Something from your childhood. Something 
'not good'.  You hear the sound of church bells ringing then silence, followed by more buzzing, more clicks. Suddenly 
this seems like a really bad idea.  What does Keith really want here?  He's always been the independent type. Does he 
really want help or is he just playing you?  You are about to open your eye but then there is more buzzing, two more 
clicks, and a voice.  It sounds thin, nasally, distant, and in the background, the sound of shrieking.  You feel like 
the world is slipping away from you.  The voice is saying, "Your call is important to us, please hold..."
