As the marshmallow reaches to grab the fork and rope
 - vital to your survival -
 you notice something strange.
The hand is moving slower than normal,
 as if it was in slo-mo.
In fact, it is much, much slower than normal.
You merely walk over it and grab
 your rope and fork before the 
marshmallow can achieve your doom.
The marshmallow exclaims, 
"I've never seen someone move with
 such lightning-quick reflexes...
 I didn't think the legends were true."
At this point, you're in a state of confusion,
 and you're sick of the sweet smell
 in the marshmallow's belly.
You wonder how you're ever going to get out, 
and as you look at the ceiling, you notice yourself 
start levitating ever so slowly.
Before the marshmallow realizes, 
you've blown a hole through its 
belly and see the outside world.
It's dark and fluffy. 
While you don't believe that you might be the One,
 it's only up to you to save the world.
