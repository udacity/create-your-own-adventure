You thought about what you can do with what you have now.

You empty your pants pockets on the grass in front of you. A pocket knife, a
block of magnesium, a flare, a first aid kit and a machete. Now that's good
news!

You bandage your leg with supplies from the first aid kit and make a leg
splint out of two nearby branches and some of the remaining bandages.

It's getting darker. In the distance, you hear something. Could... Could it
be? Yes! It's a rescue helicopter! If only there was a way to signal them..

You light the flare and wave it over your head! Suddenly you realize, that
under all this thick foliage, there is no way they are able to see it... Of
course! You throw the flare at the tree that holds your parachute. Immediately,
the flare sets it ablaze! You hear the sounds of the helicopter's rotor blades
approaching. It lands in a small nearby field. You're saved! As you limp
towards the helicopter, and see stewardesses approach you with champagne and
refreshments, you think to yourself:

"Phew. That could have gone very differently!"

The first stewardess hands you a familiar looking iphone 5se as she says it's
for you. The phone is ringing, but it's not someone calling, the alarm clock is
going off. But how did she have your own phone, the one you were missing from
your back pocket. And why won't the alarm turn off. You keep pushing snooze and
snooze but it keeps ringing. And your leg starts hurting.

You wake up sprawled out in the leaves and dirt. Ugghhh the helicopter rescue
was too good to be true.  The dire situation you are in comes back to you, but
seems even more hopeless after the dreamed rescue. Your realize the stabbing
pain in your leg had made you pass out, but it's only a dull ache now.

You hear your iphone alarm going off in the direction of those trees over
there. You didn't dream that part, but it looks dark over there.
