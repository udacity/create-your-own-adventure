You live a life in which the only reprieve from the deep 
dissatisfaction with your choices is the immeasurable pain which stems from 
watching everything you love and could have fought for be destroyed to make
 room for the objects of greater persons' wishes.

You finally die, the few people who you knew morn for the minimum time required.
 Not out of loss but out of the fact that you are not worth the effort it would take to 
justify their lack of sorrow to their acquaintances.
