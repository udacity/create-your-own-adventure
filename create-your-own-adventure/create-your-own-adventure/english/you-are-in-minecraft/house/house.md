You start contemplating on the thought of building your first Minecraft house, an important landmark no doubt.
What sort of house will it be? Will it be well hidden? Will it be fancy?

More important, what part of the house should I build first?

The roof?

The walls?

Should I prepare the terrain first?

Maybe start with doors and windows?

You have a lot of decision making ahead of you...
