... you know it's one of those days.  
The sun is shining, 
birds chirping in the trees, 
slight fresh sented breeze
... you know a bit like one of those Frebeeze commercials
You knotice how the breeze feels good on your skin
warmed by the late afternoon sun.
Ahhhhh... nice to just be alive.

Pretty lucky afterall.

Well, except for this guy who looks like me with a gun in my face.

But then again... your realize... this IS your lucky day.

You smile.
He smiles.

You give a little chuckle
He gives a little chuckle

And in tha tinstant of mystical connection 
togehter you come to the simultaneous conclusion that 
you know what's really lucky?

It's that you BOTH saved 15% on your car insurance by switching to GEICO.

Ahhhhh
so lucky.
