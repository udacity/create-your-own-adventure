You leap onto the hand and ride that thing like a
bucking bronco. Careening round the room you whoop 
and holler with delight as the hand leaps to and fro
trying to dislodge you.

Suddenly, the hand makes a huge lunge to the left, throwing 
you off balance and head-first into the marshmallow wall.

You are stuck.

Dangling by the head.

Things do not look good.

The hand is angry.
