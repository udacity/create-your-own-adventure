The vast amount of coffee has filled up your bladder until the pressure is more than you can bear.  With nibble 

feet you rush to the bathroom, close the door, and release the flow, ah...  Once you are finished, you flush the 

toilet and wash your hands.  As you are getting ready to exit, you notice a small door on against the side wall.

In your rush to urinate, you did not notice it before, but now your bladder has been emptied and your mind is 

free to dwell on the curious nature of things.  As you reach for the door, you ponder the wisdom of the decision

you are about to make.  Somewhere in the depths of your conscienceness, you know to enter this door is to 

leave this world behind and alter your fate forever.  You reach for the handle, hoping to stop yourself but 

knowing your curiosity cannot be muted as you....
