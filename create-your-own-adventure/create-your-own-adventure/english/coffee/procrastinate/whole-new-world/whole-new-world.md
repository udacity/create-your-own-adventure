Alas, not even Twitter is safe from this madness! As you scroll through the
feed, you notice your awareness narrowing into the screen, losing any sense
of the rest of the world...

...was the screen always that big?...

...why are the pixels so close, now?...

...was it really Twitter you were on? You don't remember switching, but you
don't feel the phone in your hand, anymore...

Suddenly, you find yourself in device-which-may-or-may-not-be-your-phone,
looking out of the screen. Are you in a [Virtual
Reality?](./../../../virtualreality/oculus.md) Perhaps you have [fallen into
Minecraft.](./../../../you-are-in-minecraft/minecraft.md)
