You start running away from the marshmallow creature. As you get further away you can see with the corner of your eye
that he stopped moving and he is looking towards you somewhat amazed. You realize that you have no courage whatsoever 
and are actually running from a 4 foot tall marshmallow humanoid, maybe it is time for change.
