You weren't sure how it happened, but you suddenly remembered a story about yellow baby
buggy bumpers. But you didn't actually "remember" it; it was more of a dead link in
your brain. You remember the phrase "yellow baby buggy bumpers" from your past, it reminds
you of your youth. But you don't know what it means.

After many days of not eating or sleeping while trying to recall what that phrase meant,
you suddenly make a decision. You want to take a bumper car ride while dressed in your
favorite yellow suit and sucking your thumb. You're not sure it is the best decision for
your career but you know it's the right thing to do.

You then start walking towards the amusement park.

As you approach the park, you get a foreboding sense that not all is right. 
You see the park in the distance. It is night, and the park is full of lights.
The ferris wheel is turning.
