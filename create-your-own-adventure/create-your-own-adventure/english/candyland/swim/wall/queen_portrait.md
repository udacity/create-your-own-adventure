You swim toward the wall to inspect the portrait more closely.  

Milkshake is surprisingly not much more difficult to swim through than regular water.

The portrait shows an older woman with beautiful silver hair.  

She is holding a scepter topped with a perfect snowflake sculpture.

She looks regal and wise.

You are not used to swimming this much and you feel your arms and legs begin to tire.
