Tibetan Language

Tibetan Language is derived from Indian Sanskrit. During king Songtsen Gampo, who was devout believer of Buddhism wanted to incorporate Buddhist philosophy from India. So he invited many scholar from Nalanda Univ in India and also sent many scholar from Tibet to India to learn Buddhism from India. Henceforth Tibetan language was created by Great Scholar Thumi Sam Bhota.

Subsequently he translated most of the Buddhist philosphy text into Tibetan. 

So these days, the great treasure of scholarly work of many ancient Indian scholar from Nalanda University is only available in Tibetan Language in its best form.
