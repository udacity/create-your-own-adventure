Your feet follow your body as you stumble into a clearing, breathing hard.
You look around. The walls, the ground, the sky, that smug tree over there,
all of this looks painfully familiar. You are running out of time, and you
can't remember how long it's been since you saw another being. If there's one t$
you've ever been sure of, it's this: you have to do something different. The
clearing is surrounded by a thick ring of impenetrable brush, excepting three
gaps leading to the east, west, and south. Sweat gathers at your brow.
Your heart is pounding. You steel your nerves and look around, each option
resembling the last. You take a deep breath dart toward the
[gap](./loop.md) leading to the west, only to stop sharp and stand straight.
Didn't you take that route last time? You walk calmly and deliberately to
the [void](./loop.md) in the brush leading to the north. As you get closer,
you realise this looks familiar too. You breath deeply and congratulate
yousrself for being attentive. All it takes is logic and perception to solve
any problem life throws at you. You break into an unhurried jog and make your
way through the [opening](./loop.md) to the east.
