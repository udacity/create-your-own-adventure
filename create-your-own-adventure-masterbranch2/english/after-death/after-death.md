And they say, “There is not but our worldly life; 
we die and live (i.e. some people die and others live,
replacing them) and nothing destroys us except time.” 
And they have of that no knowledge; they are only assuming. 
And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences,
their argument is only that they say, “Bring [back] our forefathers, 
if you should be truthful.” Say, “God causes you to live, 
then causes you to die; then He will assemble you for the Day of Resurrection, 
about which there is no doubt,” but most of the people do not know.
