You stand, alone on the empty beach, puzzled by the honey 
covering your body. (Aren't you glad you weren't wearing a 
wetsuit to entrap you in the honey?) You ache to examine 
the honey, but how? Suddenly you notice, on the badger's 
armchair, his pad and pen. There is a note on the pad - 
"Fill me" - with an arrow pointing to the right. Next to 
the arrow you discover an empty jar with a butter-knife 
in it.

You take the jar and, with the butter knife, you fill it 
by scraping the honey from your skin. Staring into the 
depths of the honey, you are transfixed.
