You find that the walls are very thin, so you quickly break through.

The effort has left you exhausted, but outside, you see a forest.

A lush green forest with an unsettling feeling about it.

A big, black bird approaches.

It says "hello"

"Hello, Mr Bird!", you say, and spot a collar with a tag on it.

The collar is worn dark brown leather, and the tag is faded silver. A very unusual looking bird indeed.

Upon inspecting the tag, you see it reads: "Nevermore". Turning over the tag, you see: "If found, please return to:
Outis, 13 West Range, U. Virginia".

Below this it reads, "Rub me three times".

"Well, Nevermore, shall we return you to your owner?"
