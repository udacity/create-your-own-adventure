Your flare flies into the sky, spewing out sparks and making crackling noises.

The chococopter has shifted its orientation and is facing you. 

You're saved! The chococopter has noticed you. 

Then suddenly from your right side a black pillet grazes your hair.

A barrage of hot, melty chocolate chip bullets are rainy down upon you. 

The pain is unbearable! Just as you are about to pass out, the 

chococopter moves in. The wind from the rotors blows the melty chocolate chip

bullets away saving you from certain death. The chococopter wisks you away to a 

submarine that is waiting nearby.  

You scamper quickly to the submarine for safety.  As you approach the craft you realize 

that it is floating in a river of rapidly flowing chocolate apparently from all of the chocolate

chip rain.  As you near the edge of river you further realize the craft you spotted was not

a submarine but a finely tuned water craft piloted by a whacked out man and tiny orange men.  It

is beginning to rain chocolate chips again...
