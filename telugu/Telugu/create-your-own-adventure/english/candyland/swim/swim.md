You walk over and try to stand in the melted marshmallow.

You realize that it doesn't feel like marshmallow at all. 

It is not sticky and in fact is quite milky smooth. 

You lean forward and lick the frothy concoction.

Your mouth is filled with a sweet sugary creamy sweet delight.

You start to realize the milk is getting very cold and deep.

The viscous icy chunky liquid is now up to your chin so you begin to move your limbs to stay afloat.

You are now treading milkshake. 

You see an ominous looking picture on the wall with a Queen standing by a sign in front on a sea.

The sign in the picture says: "The Ice Cream Sea"
