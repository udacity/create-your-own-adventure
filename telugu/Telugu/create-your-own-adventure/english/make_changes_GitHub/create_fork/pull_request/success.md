You create a pull request on GitHub and hope that someone can quickly review your changes and agree to merge
your branch into the upstream master branch. You cross your fingers that it works... and quick. Your bladder can
only contain so much pee.

Seconds later, a wormhole appears!!

You step into it and hope for the best. You close your eyes and within a split second, you open your
eyes to see that you are back in your room.

You immediately run into your bathroom and had the greatest pee session ever.
Everything was alright in the world.




Thank goodness for GitHub! 

But wait, you're an elite software engineer. The comforts of your home don't keep you entertained for long. You're  
bored. You start thinking of the marshmallow adventure again. You long for that adrenaline rush and using your
skills to get out of trouble. You look for the wormhole. It's still there.
