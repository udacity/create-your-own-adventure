Instead of flying like Superman, you plummet to earth like a rock!
The air roars in your ears as you realize you made a horrible mistake.

You don't know which muscle to contract. Surely flapping your arms like the
birds won't help. Doesn't even look graceful.

Do you:

A. Panic.
B. Call 911.
C. Teleport up to a passing Vogon constructor ship.
