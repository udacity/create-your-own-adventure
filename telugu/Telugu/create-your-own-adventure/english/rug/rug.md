You bend over and pick up the the soft, but ragged red rug. 
As you lift it you notice a golden handle on the floor underneath. 
After further messing up the rug by pushing it aside some more, 
a hidden trap door is revealed and connected to the handle. 
Just as your fingers take hold of the cold gold metal handle,
you hear voices coming from far down the hallway.

The first voice had a moderate, smooth pitch, but was clearly irritated and berated to the other, 
"Listen man, all I wanna do is play some b-ball, 
but y'all hadda roll up and started making trouble in my neighborhood!"

You, scared and confused, make the split second decision 
to open the trap door and climb down into the darkness, 
for fear of being noticed by the approaching voices.
