Stephen King’s “The Dark Tower” series follows the adventures of Roland, 
a gunslinger, in a magical land full of adventure and mystery.

Part of Roland’s quest involves a “tower”.

If the two in our series is any way related to SK’s tower, then we should
let Mr. King know that it is on fire so that he can save it.
