The tower is too far away. Walking there would take too long.

But if you had your magic towel, you could use it to fly to the tower in just a few seconds.

Or if you just had a regular towel, you could wave it in the air and hope that someone
would see you and give you a ride.

Ah ha! You suddenly have a genius idea.

Maybe you should just go home, take your magic towel out of the laundry, and fly to the tower.
If all goes well, you should be at the tower within five minutes.

There's just one thing wrong with this new idea...
