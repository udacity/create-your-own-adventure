  Now you are in the chocolate pool, you are wondering if there are any 
living creatures in that pool. You keep swimming and swimming.However,you 
can't find out how deep that pool is.The pool is so wide that you can't
even guess its width or its length. Suddenly, you hear a strange voice.
You drink some chocolate to keep you calm, but you can't stop trembling.
what do you think about this voice??

1.Is it a [bananaboat](bananaboat/bboat.md) floating on the pool surface?

2.Is it the sound of the [hazelnults](hazelnuts/hazel.md) terittory?
