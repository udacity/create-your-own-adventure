Keith the Unicorn looks at you with disgust. "Dude, you know I gave up last week. I thought you were my friend man. You
know my dad just died from cancer and that I decided to give up and make a positive change in my life and you just said
sure? You're meant to support me man, I'm dissapointed..."

You feel awkward, realise that unicorns named Keith are overrated and decide to [wake up](../existence/existence.md).
