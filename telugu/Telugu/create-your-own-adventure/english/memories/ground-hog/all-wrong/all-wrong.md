That voice... This can't be right. Not here. How could he know where to find
me. Not after all this time. Surely I'd have known if he was still alive.

"You've grown into a fine lady," he said. He sounded genuinely happy, though
the remorse and sadness nearly overpowered that, "and married a fine man. He
has already been better to you than I could have been -- to you and your
mother."

He was close. It was almost as if he materialized on the bench next to me in
the park.

I'm [leaving](../wakeup.md). I can't listen to this.
