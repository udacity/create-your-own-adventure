You open the glovebox of the Winnebago and then realize this is no ordinary Winnebago. You pull out
a can and inspect it closely, looking curiuosly at the dark masked figure with a huge helmet on the front.

The label reads "Liquid Schwartz - Extra Strength. One can to planet Spaceball."

Confused, but intrigued, and thinking anything is better than being eaten by marshellows, you dump
the whole can into a fuel recepticle in the front cabin. The Winnebago sprouts wings and carries you
off on autopilot across the galaxy, leaving a plaid trail behind you.
