*Ploop* 

What a rush!

"Hey guys!" you scream out to all the other droplets in the sanctuary. 
You squeeze between an endless stream of little beings just like you. 

One droplet says, "Look out! A fish is coming!"

You feel yourself being pulled into a vortex created by the gaping maw of a fish,
and try to will yourself in another direction.

You race to get out of the way before the fish gets to you.

Some droplets didn't get out of the way fast enough and were taken by the fish.

Some droplets around you begin to cry because their friends were taken by the fish.

"It's ok!" you console them. "They'll come out the other end!"
