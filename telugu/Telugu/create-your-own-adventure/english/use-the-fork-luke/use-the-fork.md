The hand of marshmallow has left you with so many questions. What did it want with the lighter?
What does it want with me? Why did it have a ring-finger tan line?
What am I doing with a coin in my pocket? (if you don't have any coins, 
you may say ["Valar Morghulis"](../valarmorghulis/valarmorghulis.md).)

It is obvious that these questions will have to wait, and you switch into survival mode. Examining your items closer,
you realize the lighter has enough butane for one - maybe two - small flames before it is empty. In one fluent motion,
without any hesitation you hold the rope high in your left hand while setting it ablaze with all the remaining fuel
in the lighter. The fire burns quickly and brighlty - you turn around to face the marshmallow wall. Within seconds the
rope is nothing more than ash, the flame gone. It is NOW that you realize that it is better to have a plan before
committing to action.

You fall to the floor, all hope seems lost. Then you hear it! A voice... "Use the fork, Luke!".

Without hesitation you grab the fork, you hold it high! Instantly you realize that you should have planned
something - ANYTHING - before jumping to action! When will you learn? Your name is not even Luke! Your second attempt
at freeing yourself from this nightmare appears to be just as fail-tastic as your first. But the voices keep nagging
at you, repeating themselves over and over, growing louder each time.

    "Use the fork, Luke"
    "LUse the fork, Luker"
    "Lurnse ta fork, Luzer"
    "Lurn to fork, Loser"
    "LEARN TO FORK, LOSER!!!!"

OF COURSE - YOUR UDACITY TRAINING!! The voices of Jedi Masters Caroline and Sarah become crystal clear,
and your Git training comes flooding back to you in a an instant. You hesitate - but just long enough to make
the joke work, then you get right to creating a fork of the current situation and clone it.
Feverishly  hammering away at your local git repository, you issue the command:

    git branch escape-plan

Checking out your escape plan, you use the Jedi power of Vim to create a door in your local repository.
After resetting your forgotten GitHub password,  you push the branch to the cloud. You create a pull request,
hoping to get this version into the master branch so you can get out of this nightmare!

Leveraging GitHubs power, the merge is completed in minutes. A door appears before you - this is your ticket out
of this madhouse! It is moments like these that you appreciate modern learning, and the ability to 'replay the lesson'.


Just before you step through the door, you think to yourself...

WHO APPROVED THIS MERGE?!?!

Suddenly the door creeks open to a bright blinding light, from which the silhouette
of a tall figure appears to be approaching. As the figure approaches, you start to 
realize the being is unlike any other, it walks in a strange jittery waddle. All 
this freaks you out, but you feel paralyzed, unable to move, a force grips you as 
the figure inches closer to you. You begin to realize that the the being is none 
other than Man-Bear-Pig!

You scream out of fright, and notice the reflection of the hippy holding a large 
a blue fork in the mirror next to you, even though there is no one else in the room!
He gestures for you to reach towards the mirror!
