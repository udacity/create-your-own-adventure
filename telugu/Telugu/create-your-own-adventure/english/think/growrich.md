Success is not an elusive, esoteric, god-like feature that only the special amongst us can have. It truly exists! 
And each one of us is capable of achieving it.


Love your [neighbour](loveneighbour/neighbour.md) as you love yourself.


That [fire](fire/lightfire.md) is present in each one of us. Never let it burn out!
