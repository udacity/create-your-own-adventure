You slither towards towards the person, hissing for help. Turns out it
was a young snake charmer looking for a friend. He plays his music and 
hynotizes you into doing a little dance for him. While in the trance, you
slowly grow your limbs back and your scales fall off. The charmer is pleasantly
surprised because he just finished online charm school and didn't know that he 
could turn snakes into people.
