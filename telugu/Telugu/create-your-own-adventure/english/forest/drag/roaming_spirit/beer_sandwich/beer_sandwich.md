You ask the other spirit if he knows any good places to eat.

He laughs and say he was gonna ask you the same thing.  Instead
he remarks on how he didn't know spirits got hungry.  You both
laugh.  I guess you made a new friend, but you're both still
hungry.

Your new friend asks you if you know anything about spirits and
you tell him [that you do know something about them](new_friend/new_friend.md).
