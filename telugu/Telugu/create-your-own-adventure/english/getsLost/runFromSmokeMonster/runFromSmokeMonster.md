You suddenly get the feeling of deja-vue.  This is actually an episode of Lost, and you're lost on a mysterious island.

You stumble deeper and deeper into the jungle.  A strange noise gets closer... sounds like whispers.

Could it be ---- the smoke monster from Lost!?!?!?

Quickly you scamper for safety into a banyon tree.
