Love is one of the most exciting, rewarding and satisfying of human experiences.
Whether the love of family, friends, a child or romantic love, it is a shared human adventure.
Just as high as one might feel at the tip of that love, the lows can be devastatingly painful
when it is time to let go of that loved one. Whether needing to let go because they have passed on,
or because it is time to move on from the relationship, grief is a component.
You should grieve what was lost and accept the healing hands of time. Recognize your emotional limits,
but don’t isolate yourself as you let someone go and heal from the loss.

There is no use moping around wondering the ifs, buts, could've, would've,
and should'ves. Time goes on and drags you with it. Whether you are in or
out of love, make the best of now while being aware of the worst of before.

Of course, there is no substitute for the experince of it. It must be
lived in order to be understood. All the words there are in the world 
cannot make you understand the feeling of it. Anyways, [here's

Love feels eternal but the 
pain it adds to your heart is painful

An Entrapment

My love, I have tried with all my being
to grasp a form comparable to thine own,
but nothing seems worthy;

I know now why Shakespeare could not
compare his love to a summer’s day.
It would be a crime to denounce the beauty
of such a creature as thee,
to simply cast away the precision
God had placed in forging you.

Each facet of your being
whether it physical or spiritual
is an ensnarement
from which there is no release.
But I do not wish release.
I wish to stay entrapped forever.
With you for all eternity.
Our hearts, always as one.

- Anthony Kolos - 

God is love.
Love.

PS: it's bullshit

Love is dependent on the person.
Each person can experience love in different ways.
It does not always have to be with a person.
Love can be a passion.
But depending on the person.
Love can be anything.
