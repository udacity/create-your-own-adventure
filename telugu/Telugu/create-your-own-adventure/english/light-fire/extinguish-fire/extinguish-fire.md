You grab the conveniently placed fire extinguisher to your side.

You spray the extinguisher over the roaring flames and put them out quickly.

To your amazement and horror the chemicals from the extinguisher cause a terrible reaction.

The marshmallow hardens around your feet leaving you with limited movement.

You have a chainsaw nearby but you cant cut through marshmallow.

You have only one option left.

But you won't like it.
