But wait, there in the distance... something is appearing.  Ever so slowly images are coming into view.

The images appear closer and closer; faint and colorless at first, but more defined at each passing second. 

Sound soon follows getting louder and louder as your surroundings develop all around you.  

It's as if you were caught in a time warp and now time is catching up to you.  

Your new surroundings appear familiar.  

You have a strange feeling you've been here before.
