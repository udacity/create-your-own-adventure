I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I'm a ninja, yo
My life is like a videogame
I maintain when I'm in the zone
One player one life on the mic
I'm in the dark

Yo, ninja, go

No fuckin around I'm cutting down
Anyone in my path
Tryna fuck up my game with razor sharp
Lyrical throw stars
Killin' my foes like

Hos! Ska!

Wild, outta control

Ninja skop befokte rof taal
Rough rhymes, tough times
Met fokkol kos, skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast,
When you're living on the razor edge
Stay sharp, sharp

Rolling with the $O$
High energy
Never seen zef so fresh
Uh, when we mic check
Hi-def flow's flex
Yo we aren't the messed up
Not fucking the best
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
I'm hard to miss
"You can't do this, you can't do that"
Yo, fuckin' who said so?
I do what I like
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
You can't fuck with the chosen one
I-I-I want the knife
I'm a Ninja

Hook x2

Ninja is poes cool
But don't fuck with my game
Boy or I'll poes you
Life is tough
When I get stuck
When my time is up
I push through
Till I break-break-break
on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker

Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain
It's not sore
Don't ask for kak or
You'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive

My blade swing free
Decapitate a hater with amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my light sabre like a wild fucking savage
from the dark side danger

Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek Ninjas
Motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future, but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja
