You act cool and decide to go check where the scream came from. 
You go to the bedroom and you find that it's the TV you had left on. 
You close it and start crashing things in the room. 
Then you return and tell everyone it was a thief and you scared him off. 
Everyone thinks you are soooo cool. Good for you.
