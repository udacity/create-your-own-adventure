A dragon the size of an elephant, sits in front of you and gazes adoringly at the apple.
It wags its tail like a giant Golden Retriever.  It is wearing a saddle, so you feed it 
the rest of the apple and climb aboard for a joyride.  It gallops along a long hallway,
jumps out the window, and takes flight.
