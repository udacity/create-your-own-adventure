Love is universal, some say, [French] (../french/feu-de-camp.md) is the language of love. 

Do I agree?

Just to make sure:
- [French](../french/feu-de-camp.md) is the language of love.
- [German](../german/ruderboot.md) is the language of philosophy.
- [English](../english/marshmallow.md) is the language for computer science.
