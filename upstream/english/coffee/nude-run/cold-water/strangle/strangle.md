You decide to forget the gun and go for the badger with 
your bare hands, mano y mano. As god intended.

You reflect on how awesome you are, and that Nick 
Offerman might be proud of how manly you are acting.

Unfortunately, the badger is superior in every way, 
and before you're hands get near him, he starts biting
your face off. Literally. 

As you lay dying, you realize the one lesson you forgot to
remember: Honey Badger don't care, Honey Badger get's what 
it wants.
