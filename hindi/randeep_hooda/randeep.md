Randeep Hooda (pronounced [r?d?i?p hu??a?]; born 20 August 1976) is an Indian film actor who appears in Hindi-language films. Hooda began acting in school productions at a young age. After completing his studies in Melbourne, Australia, he returned to India and began modelling and acting in theatre.

Hooda made his Bollywood debut with Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding in 2001. However, after a good performance in the film he waited four years for a second project, Ram Gopal Varma's D (2005), which earned him critical acclaim. After D, Hooda worked on a series of critically and commercially unsuccessful projects until he featured in Milan Luthria's Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010).
