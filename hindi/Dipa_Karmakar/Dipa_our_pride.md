Dipa Karmakar, a young 22 year old Indian woman made history at the Rio 2016 Olympics
by being the first Indian woman ever to be qualified to compete in the Women's Vault 
gymnastics category. Not only did she qualify, but she also went into the final round to 
stand 4th and just missed the bronze medal by a whisker. Moreover, she displayed
her supreme courage by performing the Produnova vault - regarded as the most deadly vault.

Born into a very simple and lower middle class family with extremely scarce financial 
resources, she worked and fought every challenge in her life with her Tigress spirit.

She is an inspiration to every person out there who dreams and feels he/she is not 
good enough or does not have enough means to achieve their dreams.
