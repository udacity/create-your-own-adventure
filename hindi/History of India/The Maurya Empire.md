The Maurya Empire (322â€“185 BCE) unified most of the Indian subcontinent into one state,
and was the largest empire ever to exist on the Indian subcontinent.
At its greatest extent, the Mauryan Empire stretched to the north up to the natural 
boundaries of the Himalayas and to the east into what is now Assam. To the west,
it reached beyond modern Pakistan, to the Hindu Kush mountains in what is now Afghanistan.
The empire was established by Chandragupta Maurya assisted by Chanakya (Kautilya) in Magadha
(in modern Bihar) when he overthrew the Nanda dynasty.
